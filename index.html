				<p class="card-body"> I’m getting into the Christmas spirit . Almost everybody Loved my outfit today. I am dealing with one particularly hateful, ignorant, small, minded person. They are such a hypocrite, thinking that their freedom of speech is infringe upon because they’re not allowed to use hate speech on me hate speech, because of my freedom of expression with this kind of thing all the time. But people forgot there are certain members of the Afghanistan Taliban that are no longer around because of things. I have done so members of the American Taliban think they can intimidate me. I feel a rush of energy. case people haven’t noticed. I’m not about to back down because people want to make me scared scaring me doesn’t work so well I’ve been putting in the hospital twice since returning to the United States and it hasn’t deterred me in the least. This is my country too, and I love this country people that want to turn into a theocracy based on warped teachings of Christianity have another thing coming. Too many of my best friends made an ultimate sacrifice for this country for me to let that sacrifice be in vain by living in fear, created by intolerance homophobes and transphobes. Once you have those two combinations 99.9% of the time you’re a racist too.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am trying to stay positive with my strawberry shortcake vibe. Unfortunately, there are a small number of very intolerant people I’m in rehab with. I could clearly see their hate today. It’s more of a projection of their insecurity with their sexuality. Then they’re being a problem with who I am. I scare a lot of people because they see what it’s like to live as your true self when they are living a lie and they’re near me it makes them very uncomfortable, I am so lucky and so blessed to be the person I am. I truly feel bad for people that are just scared children in adult bodies. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am looking beautiful today, but I am stressed out of my mind. I am really been pushed to the brink of my limits. So much of my heart comes from the years lost with my kids that is blamed on me, but I’ve been an enabler. I’ve given whenever I’ve been asked, but was never allowed to have any sort of relationship so I am done giving and giving and giving with nothing in return. I’m trying to get better. Yet I’m extremely uncomfortable in my living situation. I don’t have the meds I need. I’m trying to be patient because I know I just started this program, but it makes me so angry to keep focusing on basic sobriety. I want to adjust my mental health being completely clean and sober is not my goal maybe will be later. I have a greed to be clean and sober while I’m in a program but today we touched on anger and I remember just how angry I am it’s justified angered my opinion my triggers are very real. I have never been called a f@g, and then handed a bouquet of flowers. I have had a very real and violence confrontations with people in my own country that wish extreme harm and violence towards me. In my opinion, so many people got to leave the war overseas and come home. I came home to a different type of war . A battle I’m still fighting. Not my battle with addiction, which is a battle, but fighting for my existence to live in a country or so many don’t tolerate my existence.. I am looked at as the one out of place, and so many people that I’ve been different from Main stream have always been looked at. I want to go back to using so bad I am struggling so bad it’s a constant fight with so many strong willed personalities inside of me constant nightmares that I can’t remember from my childhood. I am starting to see things in here things that I don’t think are really there, I don’t know what to do.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I got to go back to three meetings at my 930+ AA group in Montavilla . I was happy to see people that I remember there. The topic was relapse for most of them, and I was reminded of just how common relapses in that room I saw people that had far more time than me when I went into rehab have less time than me going back . Relapse is always on my mind. It was a real battle tonight within myself because I wanted to walk down to 82nd St. where I know I could get my DOC but there’s a part of me that really wants to stay clean and sober despite the parts of me that wants nothing to do a sobriety. I had every excuse in the world in my mind to use tonight. I really don’t like I don’t have all my man’s. I really don’t like my living situation. I don’t really like how some people are treating me but I do have one friend in the program I’m at that reminded me why I can’t use I need to hold myself to a higher standard than those that I use anything I do as an excuse to put me down as I’ve said many times how I dress as my uniform in the country I see is an occupied one drop behind enemy lines. Someone else deployed I wouldn’t use, so why would I use now? So many times I hear people talk about their PTSD from what they did on deployment, I feel I never got to put down my weapon. I’m still on a deployment. I’m still on constant God because there are people that literally want to unalive me in my own country. We just finished transgender awareness week without anyone making any awareness of it anywhere I could see. I definitely saw the gate. I definitely heard the hate. And I constantly keep hearing from people. When do they get their week and I want to tell them you’ve had the whole millennia.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went to the Portland VA today to get my suboxen shot. I’m supposed to get 300 mg but they only gave me 100 mg the doctor forgot I’m on Tegretol I need the higher dose or I can use on the shot. In fact I relapsed because the shot has an always worked successfully. It Hass to build up people ask why I take instead of the pills or strips each day because if I had to decide every day, I would probably stop taking them like I have many times. I can abuse them by going a week without them for one day of euphoria when I take the shot I only have to be a sound mind for one day a month I’m starting to work some things out about my mental health. It’s scary but I’ve had issues my whole life and I’m finally trying to straighten them out. I don’t blame my time in the military.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Every day is a struggle between trying to survive one more day and one more day fighting for services from the Portland veterans health administration, and then there’s always struggling to survive on the street while not receiving the benefits I’m entitled to from the Veterans Health Administration. I am not looking for service connection. I suffered a combat injury with  TBI in Afghanistan. I retired from the Army 100% service connected. I don’t understand how I can be rated so high for PTSD but not be able to get into PTSD program. Have a TBI, but unable to go to a TBI clinic. cognitive disorder and the loss of fine motor skills in my hands and arms but no occupational therapist . I arrived in Portland April 14 and I am still waiting for my August 30 endocrinologist appointment to go back on HRT. If it wasn’t for the hard work of my social worker at 5C and Vancouver in coordination with staff at 5C/SRTP I would’ve lost my mental health. I would’ve lost my dental . I would’ve had nothing !While it is something , it’s a drop in the bucket I see some people served such a short amount of time in peacetime have so many more services. They deserve the services tgey get hands down , but I would also deserve them. If not more depending on a case by case? The same way I feel there’s a lot of veterans that suffer far greater than I do and deserve far more resources, but I wonder if they’re actually getting any.   so every day I continue to fight so that hopefully next time the next veteran in my situation don’t go through this BS . And if we all rise up and demand improvement at the VA perhaps the next generation won’t have to fight tooth now just to not be put to the street and become a forgotten homeless veteran. Veterans that served honorably , what could they possibly have done to deserve the street. It’s so sad the other forgotten veterans I meet on the street. All of our stories are very similar. We were trying to get help from the VA, without that help our behaviors got us in trouble in society, and by the time we got help it was so little so late we  ended up in trouble in the program, and once we got in trouble, we were denied the rest of the services we needed and blacklisted from trying other programs. That’s  the boat I’m in right now so it’s not that I’m saying I played no wrong I’m saying the role I played was who I become. Stop coming in and telling veterans that there’s not a stigma in mental health when you stigmatizes us! Stop saying PTSD is a real diamonds in severely affected lives, , when it affects us you punish us. Stop saying substance abuse is a disease and then treating us like criminals!  Stop saying not every program is for every veteran when we only have one chance and please stop saying relapse is a part of recovery when it’s held against us and we end up on the street.  my goal is to work towards a Veterans administration that functions better than the one today. No veteran  that served with honor ends up getting thrown out like garbage homeless on the street as I have been and so many other veterans have been. I have now been in detox for one week. Today I have seven days, clean and sober. It has been so difficult detoxing off of opiates and stimulants. I don’t know why I keep putting myself through this hell it’s not like I know how to control my triggers, literally my triggers, being sexually assaulted, the last time I was raped was in Vancouver this year after being thrown off of a VA  program with absolutely no support. I just couldn’t believe how cold hearted Vancouver VA was to accuse me of something I didn’t do and then do it on a Friday afternoon and then give absolutely no support knowing what the hell my life was gonna become I went there for help. I didn’t receive any help just made my life hours but I can’t keep complaining. I need to move on regain my strength and learn goes to live and love life again if I can do that I’m ahead of the game. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Welcome to beautiful Vietnam high up in the mountains, watching the plum blossoms and down in the lower elevations of the valley they fall off and  plums are starting to grow They’ve already falling off the trees and began to grow plums. After Tết . it’s a tradition for us to come visit the Plum Orchards of Mộc Châu, Vietnam. It was so cold this morning it was 2°C and I have drove the motorbike for about 20 km maybe only 14 but with the roads here that takes over an hour my eyes were soaked with water coming down. my nose was dripping my hands were freezing cold back in Hanoi. It’s 30°C and then all of a sudden drop from it being extremely hot to be in just above freezing incredibly difficult and where we’re staying one of the windows is just a screen there’s no way to cover it so literally at night when it’s 0°C out there’s no way to plug this window and we try and stay as warm as we can with the heater, but hopefully tonight if we keep the door to the room with the windows is shot, maybe will stay a little bit warmer. But trying to take a shower or do anything in the bathroom in the morning is absolutely impossible with how cold it is but the plum orchards were absolutely beautiful. It was so nice and how many people recognized me and asked to have their pictures taken with their families with the beautiful blooming plum trees. In this area it seems people are so much kinder. Sometimes they may be a little bit confused, but I don’t get hate. I don’t get the wrong pronouns. Used a second time maybe in the beginning they might and then if I just say no and give them the cracked one and they use the cracked ones, no questions asked, why is it that America is so hateful compared to the many places in the world?￼ it’s been incredibly hard on me as my migraines have been getting incredibly bad and I’m still being ignored by my senators and veterans administration so I don’t know how much longer I can hold out ￼.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’ve got one whole week clean and sober . I made it to Sapa but it’s been foggy for two days in a row so I can’t do much yet. I really should have packed much warmer clothing . I had planned on renting my clothing but it’s not worth it on these cold foggy and rainy days. I need to keep busy . Today I think I go to Ta Van and visit the old Jungle bridge and see if it clears up enough to see any of the spectacular views. All my warm cloths are white and the roads will be mud. I forgot my heavy duty military rain poncho for a motorbike. I’m not just in recovery from the few days I drank for pain or the pain meds the hospital gave me. It’s trying to live a balanced life in the middle. All I have known and thrived in is chaos. Whether  it be the chaos of war, my mental health or self medicating, my severe impulsiveness has led me in situations others say they hate but I function best. I get hit with hate and shade all the time. But as long as it’s not from a loved one it rolls off me like water to a duck and in powers me to know I’m in a happier place than the person that hates. I don’t think I can truly hate a person. I can hate what a group may stand for , or hate and act or action , but I always feel bad for the person that hates. They  must be far more broken than I ever have been. Love  and peace to all. Both the enlightened and the ignorant 🌈🥰. #recovery #transveteran #sapavietnam #Giáy #travel #sobrietyjourney  (at Sa Pa) https://www.instagram.com/p/CpWM2_ZBzb9/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Day 6 of starting over with my sobriety. I’m on my way to Sapa to get out of Hanoi 🇻🇳 for a bit. I’m not ready for those 🇺🇸 Summer temperatures in March . After what happened in Cambodia and again not being in control not having my brothers, sisters and cousins at arms at my back was a hard reminder of not being in control. Flashbacks hand shaking and confusion, I’ve got it all. With my PTSD in full swing combined with the mania I experience being completely clean and sober is not a good mix in densely populated capital of Hanoi Vietnam. I need to recharge my soul in Sapa Vietnam and enjoy the calm even if it is only the eye of the storm. I’ve got a real sponsor I see in person so I need to finish homework something in 30 years I’ve never been given. #Inrecovery #recovery #hanoi #vietnam #transgender #transfluid #transveteran #LGBTQ  (at Hanoi, Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/CpShGAOuF9g/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Yesterday was my first day outside in Hanoi since getting out of the hospital. As many people know when I was in Siam Reap,  Cambodia. I was attacked by one person and had no problem, taking care of him.  He later  came back with three others with metal pipes and other metal weapons, and attacked me from behind, leaving me for dead. I’ve had surgery here in Vietnam and I have recovered enough to go back out. It’s been three weeks of recovery. Luckily, I still heal faster than others. Thank you for all my friends from around the world wished me well and getting better and thank you for your support. #hanoi #vietnam #hoankiemlake #xuhuong #tayhotrish  (at Hoan Kiem Lake) https://www.instagram.com/p/CpBpGgdB5Ti/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I was severely attacked in Cambodia in siem reap. There are no hate crime protections in Cambodia so the police would not even write up anything about the incident. I barely made it home to Hanoi alive, and I’m in the hospital. This man is from Alberta Canada. If anyone recognizes him, please make him famous for being part of a hate crime. He came back after this altercation and hit me from behind with a metal bar and knocked me into a sewage canal where I woke up, poked with all sorts of dirty metal things. Please stop hate crimes. Please stop hate against the transgender community and hate against the LGBTQ community. I call upon your help to make this man famous to put an end to search hate crimes abroad. Hopefully Canada has the ability to bring some justice to this hate crime of this horrific incident that happened that nothing can be done about in Cambodia. #hatecrime #transgenderhatecrime  #trangender #lgbtq #lgbtqtravel #transgendertravel  https://www.instagram.com/p/Co4VkooJ2cW/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Welcome to beautiful Vietnam high up in the mountains, watching the plum blossoms and down in the lower elevations of the valley they fall off and  plums are starting to grow They’ve already falling off the trees and began to grow plums. After Tết . it’s a tradition for us to come visit the Plum Orchards of Mộc Châu, Vietnam. It was so cold this morning it was 2°C and I have drove the motorbike for about 20 km maybe only 14 but with the roads here that takes over an hour my eyes were soaked with water coming down. my nose was dripping my hands were freezing cold back in Hanoi. It’s 30°C and then all of a sudden drop from it being extremely hot to be in just above freezing incredibly difficult and where we’re staying one of the windows is just a screen there’s no way to cover it so literally at night when it’s 0°C out there’s no way to plug this window and we try and stay as warm as we can with the heater, but hopefully tonight if we keep the door to the room with the windows is shot, maybe will stay a little bit warmer. But trying to take a shower or do anything in the bathroom in the morning is absolutely impossible with how cold it is but the plum orchards were absolutely beautiful. It was so nice and how many people recognized me and asked to have their pictures taken with their families with the beautiful blooming plum trees. In this area it seems people are so much kinder. Sometimes they may be a little bit confused, but I don’t get hate. I don’t get the wrong pronouns. Used a second time maybe in the beginning they might and then if I just say no and give them the cracked one and they use the cracked ones, no questions asked, why is it that America is so hateful compared to the many places in the world?￼ it’s been incredibly hard on me as my migraines have been getting incredibly bad and I’m still being ignored by my senators and veterans administration so I don’t know how much longer I can hold out ￼.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Today we traveled to Mộc Châu, Vietnam and went to happy land to visit all the flowers in bloom. Now the cat has ended all the fruit trees are in full blossom in this area. It’s a very beautiful sight to see all the wonderful flowers. How do I look in my outfit. In Vietnam they don’t have cultural appropriation. It’s considered a complement to wear a costume or local traditional dress of the people of the area this is not the United States. This is Vietnam. Things are very different here. They would be very confused why people would be upset at people complementing them by copying their style. It’s just one of the many differences between Vietnam in the United States. #MộcChâu #mocchau #hoamanmocchau #hoaman  #xuhuong2023tiktok❤️🌈✔️ #happyland #happylandMộcChâu #MộcChâu2023 #mocchau #mocchau2023  #travel #vietnam #transtraveler #lgbtqtravelers #transgender #xuhuong #xuhuonginstagram #lgbtqia  (at Happy Land- Mộc Châu) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn9olbbpvVq/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I hope everyone had a good Tete. Now it’s time to return to work in the school. Fortunately I was sick. Most of Ted got uninvited to the main tech with half the family. Likely my other half of the family had a wonderful cat with me and they are wonderful people. My children’s grandparents are great grandparents and don’t judge your head like other people. I hope my mother-in-law had a good time and I feel bad she got stuck in the middle. Overall, I’m extremely lonely, sad and depressed. I’ve missed all my American holidays and the one holiday. I was looking forward to got canceled on me simply because of who I am, there’s people that live in Hanoi that are intelligent and there’s people that live in villages that are extremely ignorant and fake Catholics the pretender Catholic but teach their children eight so those people I’ve talk to the priest and they’ll have a talking to cause it to nothing Jesus would do judging is not meant for us humans. I love the colors all the different wonderful things that come with Kat this is very unfortunate that it’s a holiday for family, and some people have to ruin it for everybody. #chúctết #chúctết  #tet #tetholiday #chucmungnammoi #happynewyear2023 #vietnam #xuhuong2023  #bánhchưng  #yearofthecat #nămconmèo #Lìxì #hanoi #vietnam #tếtvietnam  #tetduday #tết  (at Hanoi, Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn5ryAzJWaz/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went shopping at the top market and that was about the only positive thing in the past few days that I’ve done and right before nothing but negativity and right after it nothing but negativity I feel like I’m living in hell. I don’t actually believe in hell and I don’t mean like literally like a burning like a fire. I just made an unfair twilight zone for anything I do is wrong, and when the exact same thing is done by someone else, it’s OK for them to do, there’s no compromising cultures. My culture is completely ignored. I asked for peace during Christmas the birth of Christ and I wasn’t giving it and now since it’s Vietnamese holiday I’m not allowed to do anything because it will ruin it for the kids. What is anyone ever done for my kids in the United States nothing. I’ve done so much here in Vietnam just by being here and I realized I may have wasted the past five years of my life on the wrong family, I just have no idea what to listen to my heart loves on my brain that tells me to run I’m in a very, very mentally abusive relationship </p>
<p class="card-body"> As a transgender woman or being trans fluid, I’m not sure? I only realize how different I was in my 40s after I spent my whole career in the military. As much as they tried to help me at the second VA hospital I went to after being raped in the first VA hospital because I was a transgender woman and use she her and hers and we still house with very sick men that needed help and many of them were in the closet. After eight months of receiving help and finally built up the self-confidence and pride to be the person I was. All that has been destroyed and ripped apart by my own family here in Vietnam. I’ve had no support I did made fun of you ever they get mad they use who I am as an excuse to say they hate me. They don’t understand love has nothing to do with how you look and I leave it agreed only do it twice a week maybe three times, I’m never in the house and never around other people she knows which is a compromise. I should be forced to make at this point. It feels like it’s a marriage. It can’t be fixed. It can’t be worked on because I get blamed for everything and I’m being serious when I say 99% it’s not me it’s her. When you force someone to be someone they’re not, and you call them a disgusting freak of nature for how they were born, that’s an abusive relationship when you refuse to read anything the doctors tell you about what PTSD or a traumatic brain injury does to a person you’re not really trying to carry. When you refuse to use reflective speaking to talk to each other so there’s no confusion, especially with the language barrier, not trying to fix anything you can’t constantly be told you’re hated and you have no feelings one moment and then the next moment be told something different. My mind is completely screwed with a daily basis. I’ve been told totally opposite things from minute to minute. I can barely deal with the fact of who I am without other people that are close to me, making fun of me, and making me feel even worse. This is not what I ever saw my life going. This is not something I was happy about when it first happened. But I do remember the day. I finally excepted it and was happy, that was short-lived because it was all torn away from me ripped apart for me my meeting from what living was taken from me. Now to those that I love, I’m nothing but a freak, something disgusting something to be looked down on someone that’s told them never be loved Never have a family and the most worst things you can think of abroad until I have an ex-wife it’s crazy, and so jealous that I moved on and yet somehow, her words are believed over my words to me. This is the definition of insanity to believe an ex-wife is jealous is to be a crazy person. It’s the lunar holiday and I have no idea I’ll have a place to live from hour to hour it changes constantly I’m not saying I’m perfect. I have a lot of issues, but I will give them up five years of my life away from my kids and family to be here and nothing I ever do is good enough I come last in the family I feel I feel I’m the dog of the family adult children are given me more power than me. I believed over me, I can’t raise my voice slightly, but the other person can scream at the top of their lungs. I feel like I’m living with a total narcissistic hypocrite, and I don’t know what to do because my heart is still in it, but that’s how it’s always been my mother was very abusive and ever since I’ve been attracted to very abusive women, and I don’t know why I’ve never once been with a woman isn’t violent towards me. ￼ I’m trying to have a good lunar new year which is a major holiday here but when you’re scared out of your mind of what you’re gonna do because you’re threatened with being kicked out of the country and kicked out of the house you’ve given thousands tens of thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work and money into Very disappointing. I don’t know what to do.. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> 🧧“Ngay Tât niên” shopping at the Tết market in the old quarter of Hanoi Vietnam, picking up some last minute gifts and lucky money envelopes to give to all the children. Absolutely gorgeous this time of year in Hanoi. Têt is almost here! It’s the biggest holiday in Vietnam lasting up to 10 days some years. It falls at the same time as Chinese new year but here in Vietnam it year of the cat not year of the rabbits. Absolutely everything will be closed down so don’t plan on visiting vietnam this time of year unless you have a family that’s invited you for all of Tết have a happy new lunar new year or chúc mừng năm mới! #chúcmừngnămmới2023 #lunarnewyear2023 #lunarnewyear #chucmungnammoi #tết #tet #tetholiday #tetmarket #tết🌈 #transgenderTết  (at Old Quarter, Hanoi, Vietnam.) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cnqh-A8Jya2/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Being transgender in a country that isn’t exactly excepting of the LGBTQ community is hard enough. I live in the north, or even in the major city of Hanoi. It’s kind of like the Bible belt. We have the huge celebration of T￼￼êt coming up. It’s kind of like Chinese new year, but with be very insulting to tell a Vietnamese person that. Not only am I leaving the city. I’m going to a very remote village where I’m absolutely hated. They know me from TikTok and even though I must dress like a man, where are things that make me incredibly upset? I’m forced to do it because that’s what I do for people I love. I’ve been miserable every Tete that I’ve had to go to the village. I get super sick. Everyone makes fun of me they laugh at me and I’m so angry at how been treated this year. I’m really scared I’m gonna just punch somebody in the nose and just get all my anger out and just beat him to a pulp because there’s some people that I’ve done nothing but cause problems for me in my life they pretend to be a good person, but there is a snake in the grass. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Our family is getting ready for Tết. It’s year of the cat. I’m very worried about how it’s going to go. I’m going to try my hardest, but it will be very difficult on me. Being forced to look away that I hate looking like for 10 days is it going to be extremely difficult. But unfortunately many people in my family just don’t understand what it means to be transgender or some of them are just downright hateful. And I don’t know how they were raised that way or why they came out that way or why they pretend that they’re intelligent yeah, the most ignorant people I’ve ever met. I feel horrible for the people that are older in our family that are picked on and teased, but why am I the one to be blamed for how ignorant and stupid other people are. Especially villages outside of Hanoi have some of the most ignorant uneducated people I’ve ever met, so there’s no even trying to convince them that what they’re saying is technically going against the law. And these people don’t have enough money to buy anything special, let alone be garnished, or have their house taken away from them for protesting the government. I’m happy that at least the health minister is on the side of the LGBTQ and has made it a crime to call it a mental illness or say that someone sick or that someone’s needs help. I’m getting so sick and tired of certain Vietnamese complaining about my make up. I’ve been nice I haven’t been rode, but I find how many of them wear it very ugly very plain all they do is pretend to be white and white in their face. They put nothing on their eyes. They were way too red of a lipstick and everything that they wear reminds me of the movie pretty woman. So if they only knew how Westerner saw them, they would be so embarrassed of how they dress and wear their make up. Yet they have the nerve to tell me that Japanese, Korean and American make up isn’t as good as Vietnamese. My make up would never work if I tried to wear it Vietnamese style. But that is the time of family. I just really pray and hope there are no incidents. I really wish certain people would at least try the suggestions that I give, so that we have a successful and happy new year. When I try my hardest to change, and I see other people around me, making no effort to do the things I ask I don’t know what to do about it. And I’ve now found out I don’t have more than five years to live the way I live now I have the OnStar of dementia. My mind is trying to mush for my brain injury. The very scary thing to know you’re going to die at a very early age. and for people to insult me and be mean to me when all I want is to be happy in the last few years of my life is that really too much to ask. Today I was happy it was very cold and the streets here in Hanoi are completely insane. Nothing explains how to get anywhere. It took me two hours to go. It should only been two minute 20 minutes because their signs don’t match up with Google maps. If you miss it turn you have to drive for another 20 minutes before you can turn around whoever planned the highway system obviously had no idea what they were doing. Hopefully this rail system has some sort of way to allow people to transport their motorbikes because if it doesn’t nobody’s gonna take it, Vietnamese don’t walk I see the ride a motorbike to go 500 feet so to expect them to take mass transit and have to walk God for bid one or two blocks I don’t see ever happening, but I hope everybody’s getting ready for Tat anyone that’s a foreigner a new remember there’s not gonna be any grocery stores open there’s not gonna be any restaurants open may be a few in tayho, but if you’re outside of ĐTao, you’re out of luck you better stockpile your food right now and start planning what you’re gonna do because everything‘s gonna be closed there’s not gonna be places to go this not gonna be places to do as the days go on, slowly, things will open but in the very beginning you would better expect mass crowds so if you haven’t made reservations on the bus or made plans, you’re stuck you’re not going anywhere this late in the game.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Well, peace and love, good health, fortune, and all the other things you say during this holiday be upon you. Even if Congress has no wish in helping me and doesn’t care of this disabled combat veteran dies without the medical attention, desperately needed to save my life. My son Andrews are from Hawaii and it completely ignored me Senator Bernie Sanders, that I talk to you in person has lied my senators from New York in which I am listening, had completely ignored me when I was registered to vote in Washington state, they ignored me as well, so Congress if they wonder why are immigration system is broken it’s because they purposely make it impossible for illegal immigration. It is much easier and cost about 1/10 to 1/100 of the cost to come into the country illegally. My wife and children are my military dependence. yet again the American government has destroyed another holiday by ignoring us, and not caring that I have no way of getting medical attention. Vietnam does not work with the foreign medical program, and I cannot just go to the United States alone without my family. I’ve tag some of the senators that are causing all these problems for me. Make sure to vote them out, or at least write, and complain to them because for some of them the alternative is far worse. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Getting ready for Têt </p>
<p class="card-body"> (Vietnamese Lunar anew year) time to buy our peach blossom tree and kumquat tree. It’s Vietnams largest and most important Holiday. It’s like our New years, Christmas, thanksgiving, birthday, 4th of July and Easter all rolled into one  10 day long Holiday.It  is very insulting to call Têt “Chinese new years”to Vietnamese. This is not Chinese new year. Kids get lucky money and family travel from all over to be together. It will be a very uncomfortable time of year for me. I will be  in a rural village where many can’t read or write let alone know how ignorant they are towards the LGBTQ community. To save family face I must dress in a suite and pretend to be macho and masculine. I don’t speak the language, so I’m generally  ignored due  to the language barrier  and forced to ignore a snake of a man the family is not related to by blood but claims to be Christian but does nothing but judge others and swindle people. It will take all my self control not to beat him to@a pulp if he tries to embarrass me as he always tries to do. Têt is a time to be happy and share with family yet every Têt he has judged me and told me I’m not Catholic because I don’t follow the cult he is in of false teachings. I pray for no issues, and hate having to visit an even more, ( but want will be happy to see family if they can behave themselves)ignorant place than I live. It’s like dealing with people from the Westboro church. I hate how terrible I’m treated by ignorant jealous </p>
<p class="card-body"> People here in Hanoi. The rest of the country no one cares. Calling any one LGBTQ mentslly Ill I’d technically illegal .  It’s dissent against the government but some people are do dumb and stupid to realize they are breaking the law and make their country look Barbaric and uncivilized when they speak like that. Very few foreigners have returned to Vietnam compared to neighboring countries . People think most people in Hanoi are friendly because </p>
<p class="card-body"> They smile. But while they smile they insult you in Vietnamese’s the same time, it shocks them when they find out I understand what they just said. You could video record them saying it snd to save face they would still lie and say the camera made a mistake and they never said what was recorded. I really hate that about the culture of Hanoi. Thank goodness most of the youth are not so hateful but I get embarrassed at how babied adult kids are thstv will grow up to be helpless. At least mybdsughtersxarecstringvwomsn and girls and would never wine over such basic things. I’m so proud of them for that .   </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent the night out exploring night life in Sa Pa, Lào Cai. The lights all lit up are so beautiful. It gets so cold at night here. I look forward to going to Cát Cát Today. Been really struggling with migraines and how difficult some people are on me for being born trans but not knowing it until late in life. Those people where never really my friends just used me when I looked how they thought I should look. No one needs fake shallow friends at least I have family that supports me and understands how difficult life is for me. My TBI has started to show signs that are similar to dementia. So I don’t have many years left where I can function on top of other disabilities. Giving up so much and  not  having proper medical care was worth it to be near those that love me and I love more than anything in the world. #SapaVietnam #Sapa #chúcmừngnămmới2023 #xuhuong #chucmungnammoi #fyptravel #travelvietnam #travelvietnam2023 #xuhuong2023tiktok❤️🌈✔️ #xuhuong2023 #xuhuong #anythingforlove #transfluid #transgendertravel #transgender #gendernonconforming #loveislove #laocaiprovince #fyp (at Sa Pa) https://www.instagram.com/p/CnKyiC5hnDL/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Merry Christmas from Hanoi Vietnam. This is the 10th year I’ve gone without having a real Christmas. Five of those years were in Vietnam. One of those years was in the veterans hospital. One of those years was in an army hospital recovering from a combat injury. And a few of those years were me recovering from the war in Afghanistan, living out in the wilderness. Living in Hanoi Vietnam can be so lonely. Before Covid hit we were able to afford both a house in an extremely Vietnamese area and an apartment in tayho where all the Westerners live so I didn’t feel so alone. Christmas is no different than any other day here in Vietnam, Christmas Eve was celebrated like a giant rave with laser shows in half naked women dancing. Even trying to go to church. It was drowned out by the rave music. I can’t blame the Vietnamese. It’s not part of their culture but the second largest religion here is Catholicism. But the type of Catholicism practice here is a very warped form that I can’t understand at all that’s completely different than the Catholicism I was raised with, somethings are similar but other things are very different. The Christmas music here really needs to be changed. They constantly play 80s music Michael Bolton all sorts of music that I can’t stand listening to it over and over again. Now that the solar new year is coming up all I’m gonna hear is Abba’s happy new year with people here not realizing what a depressing song that is. Listening to that makes me wanna just end it all sometimes. People think that everybody in America plays that song all throughout New Year’s and I trying to explain to them I have never heard that song before coming to Vietnam. Being transgender in Hanoi Vietnam, or the northern part of Vietnam is kind of like being trans in the Bible belt or states completely dominated by conservative Republicans that are very hateful and only pretend that they’re Christian but in no way shape or form do they act Christian at all.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Read Matthew 19:10-12 </p>
<p class="card-body"> The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry." </p>
<p class="card-body"> 11 But he said to them, "Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. 12 For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it." (ESV) </p>
<p class="card-body"> For those that don’t know what a Unick is it would be very similar to someone that had a sex reassignment surgery with the technology available to thousand years ago. And it actually states that they become trans with the glory of God. If you read the Bible men would actually castrate him selves, becoming a third gender in order to glorify Christianity, so how is it that so many people that claim to be Christian can be so against those that are transgender when it clearly states in the Bible that there is no sin in it many people read the old testament and think the laws of Deuteronomy, or Leviticus, or numbers are still to be followed today. We are not Jewish we are not Muslim. If we all ourselves Christian we only need to obey the New Testament, when Jesus died, the old covenant along with all the laws and rules of the old testament were broken and gone. I’m not a person for organized religion. I just can’t stand the arguments that are constantly used to hate me. So many Americans are so ethnocentric they make up 5% of the world, and don’t realize that most of the nations occupied the United States before the European genocide. Mostly all of them believed in multiple genders up to 20 different genders. The Lakota and the Iroquois just to name a few in India to get a visa and your passport. You have to list one of three genders. In Thailand, there’s six well recognized genders. Through science alone if you want to make the argument that God made only male and female, explain why chromosomes lineup in at least eight different ways forming eight different sexes. Normally we have XX for a female or XY for a male. ￼ But we also have XXY, which is a hermaphrodite or YYY, which is known as superman syndrome. So if God is infallible and only creates male and females, why is it that there are more than two sexes created by this so-called creator, so the argument that God only made male and female is Noll and void. ￼ It’s becoming increasingly difficult to live in Vietnam. I’ve written my Congress representatives a written my senators there’s ignored me since 2011 when I first got out of the hospital after being injured in combat in Afghanistan. I personally Matt Bernie Sanders, Envogue room, where he gave me his personal word that he’d be there for me as Vermont soldier if anything was to go wrong Yet I have never heard back to him to this day 12 years later I hear constantly from the people that work for my senators they can’t do anything and they can’t intervene yet that’s a complete lie because I’ve seen people that are very wealthy and make huge donations have their senators intervene and look into federal buildings that are committing gross misconduct. in all federal buildings which includes an embassy or consulate, you cannot make a transgender joke to an American citizen. All I was given was a link that they should know, cannot be opened in a foreign country. There is not on the best of terms with the United States. Of course we’ve come a long way since the 70s but I still can’t access a government site unless they’re asking me to break the law and use of vpn and circumnavigate the Vietnamese Firewall or for all I know it’s the American side keeping foreign countries from accessing government sites. Either way I have no way of complaining about the interview were at window 19 on November 1 the day after Halloween at the US consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City where they made fun of me, laughed, teased and told me my visas were granted for my family and then said oh just kidding you should’ve been here on Halloween you missed it and laughed. I did not find that funny at all, they got my hopes up my wife’s hopes up and my children’s hopes up only to make us all cry by their cruelty. In their defense, I did go back on December 2 and the interviewer I had that time was very kind very respectful and fair, but the differences I dressed as I preferred to dress when I went there in November, when I went in December and was treated as a human I was forced to wear a suit and tie and play the part of what they expect, a gender rol </p>
<p class="card-body"> ￼ These people really need training they don’t understand that you can be gender, nonconforming non-binary. Choose not to pick a side be a transgender woman be a transgender man it doesn’t matter. Either way you can keep all your body parts. I am a male when it comes medically, to my sucks, I have all the parts I was born, with. I do not take hormones, and I was born attracted to women. I have no issue with those other attracted to the same sex, multiple sexes or only two sexes I don’t care it’s none of my business. But the law does clearly state a marriage here is between a male and a female as their sex gender and sex are completely different if you look it up in the dictionary, gender is defined as a construct. It is just what society agrees, makes a male or female, or however, many genders they have. There is no universal rule for what makes up a gender, having certain Jenna Tallia does not make you a certain gender go to India and you will find the third gender has a penis but they are more female then they are male they dress like a female they look like a female and they do the raw that females do. I’m just so sick and tired of the ignorance and it’s not like it’s any better back home in the United States. I’ve read the Republicans made their platform in the last election on denying youth all sorts of things that I wish I had growing up I’m 43 and I’ve been confused my whole life, I never knew what transgender was. I was raised in a very Catholic family where if you liked anything having to do with the opposite gender it meant you were homosexual and homosexuals went straight to hell and as a child hell scared me you should not use the threat of hell on a child, especially a child that is confused as they go through puberty as to what’s happening to them. ￼ Before puberty my mother had no problem with me playing with Barbies wearing my sisters clothing but then once I hit puberty doing that on any day, but Halloween and I was called gay I was called all sorts of names. Even my father didn’t really understand things. I remember him getting very upset that my brother sat down to P. I think it had more to do with just we were in an RV and my brother had never use the toilet in an RV before and probably just didn’t know how to use it properly, everyone calls me a fake a phony because I was career military I didn’t have to make these choices I put a uniform on and I was happy I wore uniform all sexes all genders wear the same uniform in a time of war. I never really had many opportunities to wear my dress blues. We would see a difference And I believe even females in the military could wear pants and didn’t have to wear the skirt so there was no real difference in our uniform not the way it used to be 20 3040 years ago and I’m begging my senators to get involved in the illegal activity going on at the US consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City. Discrimination of any sort is still discrimination and is still illegal and Congress does have the power to launch an investigation. They never helped me regain my G.I. Bill I became disabled permanently from a combat injury in Afghanistan that went back to the day. I came off of title 10 orders. They actually lowered my G.I. bill to 50% because they said I spent too much of the time recovering in Madigan Army medical facility at joint base Lewis McChord. Yes you heard that correctly. I had my G.I. bill reduced because I was in a hospital recovering from a combat injury and Congress did nothing to help me then either I am being charged for survivors insurance that the person who would go to doesn’t qualify to receive it and I’ve been fighting this for three years so I have $200 garnished from my pay for no reason, I don’t have another $300 garnished from my pension for no reason they claim when I stopped taking payment for drill because I received at the time only 40% VA disability that I was earning retirement points and those retirement points had value but I was medically retired so I never use those retirement points so they had absolutely no value and they claimed I owe them  </p>
<p class="card-body"> ￼ But the military only sees you as a pawn, and once the pawn is knocked over and taken out of the game, you’re worthless to them you’re worthless to politicians unless you can get them a good photo op sure they want to help or make things look good, but what have they really truly done for veterans? I was the veterans Hospital in Bath New York, where I clearly stated my gender was female and I was putting with men and I ended up being raped over it. All they did was move me to Coatesville outside of Philadelphia, where they did obey the law in the halls me with the women. The strange thing is in Coatesville we shared a bathroom and I shared a bathroom with all the other women and nobody had an issue in Bath New York. Everybody had a private room that would lock and I had a key card access And I would have no interaction with them whatsoever, but I would’ve been on a locked wing versus an open wing with no cameras. The federal prosecutor of Western New York refused to prosecute the case because he didn’t feel strongly that he could win it. I was medically sedated or medically restrained because I was constantly locked in my room because anybody could lie and say you went off grounds and you be confined to your room for 10 days. I was there for PTSD for all sorts of issues being confined to a certain room a third time in a row, and I lost it and under the law, if you don’t yell now or fight, your attacker, you can’t claim rape, and since I wasn’t incapacitated, or passed out with alcohol, but awake, I also wasn’t protected and even though I lived at a hospital facility. They considered me outpatient so I wasn’t protected as an inpatient even though it was a staff member a janitor did they told to go and check on me And they have been pretending to be nice to me pretending to be my friend so I didn’t know what was going on until it was far too late and all I got was an oh I’m so sorry this happened to you and they move me to the female wing for one day while investigators came, and then, as soon as they left, they made me move all my stuff right back to the men’s section I sure hope Sean and Bonita are not still in charge of the bath New York DOM ￼ as I was constantly discriminated against constantly told what I couldn’t couldn’t wear. Yeah, I was amongst men that would walk around naked take off their clothes, and I would get in trouble because people would knock at my door and I was nice enough to buy coffee for people that couldn’t afford it because that VA didn’t provide coffee and one time I answered the door and I was only half dressed, and I got reported for indecency. Don’t come knocking at my door at 6 AM on the weekend expecting me to be fully ready and fully dressed. I was in the middle of getting ready and there’s nothing you couldn’t see on me you could see my chest OK I have a males chest so what exactly what is so offensive to you or people would complain that they could see a bulge in my jeans, the same bold you saw on every other man on that unit yet because I dress differently I wasn’t allowed to have that same bulge in my pants and I was constantly discriminated against I wrote my representative and I wrote my congressman, and I wrote, especially congressman Schumer nothing in return. I heard nothing I wrote the head of the VA. I wrote the LGBTQ coordinator in Rochester New York and then Canandaigua nobody came down to bass. They even skipped the stand down and basically I don’t think they understood that they told everybody there it was OK to call me a queer they didn’t. They did like this last minute voice recording, where there was all sorts of things wrong with what they said, it depends on how you use the word queer it depends on the context they did not explain this they made it seem like you could just call mop to me and call me a queer which is unacceptable and people took it if they could call me a queer they could call me all sorts of other words I just can’t believe that of everybody they knew all the issues that had been going on. No one showed up no one did anything they complained  </p>
<p class="card-body"> ￼ Did I didn’t tell anybody that would make it official immediately has anyone ever been sexually assaulted or raped and not known what to do like not knowing if they’ve been built would be believed like didn’t know like how to deal with it and say you went to a priest or a chaplain or someone that you knew couldn’t go and just tell everybody in the military we specifically had people that couldn’t go and report things but you had someone to talk to. I used it the same way as I would use it in the military I’m just become so depressed. It’s at the point where I don’t want to die but I don’t wanna live either. I am so depressed. I am so beyond depressed. I would be depressed just from there being no Christmas from having no family from constantly being sick from the food here I’m pretty sure when I was in the south one of those bugs laid an egg in me I have some sort of larva growing in me. I’ve had all sorts of health issues here I had a major seizure last week. I’m literally probably gonna die here in Vietnam and yet, my son said they only intervened in extreme circumstances what is more extreme that I need medical attention I can’t fly on my own. I have no family still alive in the United States that can take care of me. I would be separated from my wife and children, if I was to attempt to go home, and I would go deeper into debt, what would normally only cost me about $1000 would cost me $10,000 to fly home with a type of insurance an escort I would need with my medical condition and then on top of all this I have to deal with the constant hate of ignorant, ignorant people in Vietnam the same people that think it’s acceptable to eat dog, pick their nose at a restaurant table, clip their toenails while they wait for their food use a toothpick and flick to the other mouth, while other people are eating clean dishes in the same area, you pee on the floor like I’m not trying to judge anyone else’s culture than I would be being ethnocentric it’s just I can’t believe there’s so much hate against me by a certain generation here when the health minister of the Vietnamese government has come out and said if you are LGBTQ, that is perfectly natural it is not a mental illness. Yeah if you protest the government I’m almost anything you immediately be arrested yet nothing happens with these people that call me mentally ill publicly post that they burn me alive. Did they hope they hit me with their car that I should be in a hospital they’re literally Causing dissent against the government. They are literally breaking Vietnamese law, but nothing happens so what is the point of having a law if you don’t enforce it. And it’s no better in the United States. I have to deal with ignorant people that I don’t even know how they can write because you need to know how to read in order to write, and they keep telling me to go get medical help and they don’t understand that. It’s not a medical problem. There’s no federal doctor that’s going to tell me being trans is a mental illness no gender dysphoria that’s a mental illness but so is PTSD from combat stress do we make fun of the soldiers the airman and the Marines the sellers Coast Guard anybody that came back from a war with PTSD and tell them that they’re sick disgusting people that need to get help because they have PTSD. No we don’t do that yet. We find it perfectly acceptable to do the same thing to somebody that maybe has gender dysphoria or somebody that doesn’t even have gender dysphoria and it’s just plain old transgender, why do we have such double standards why is it that people claim they support the troops they think that trans but then, as soon as they find out, I am a retired disabled combat veteran. I am told I am a disgrace to America. I waited eight years after retirement before I figured out who I was I never once wore anything but my uniform and what would be considered gender conforming clothing to what is expected of a male if you were in the military at the time I was, so please tell me how on earth am I a disgrace to my country and what’s worse is a lot of times it c </p>
<p class="card-body"> ￼ Served in the Marine Corps when I was much younger but that didn’t go very well. So my question do you, Congress is why on your website do you all say you have a page to help veterans and to help people with immigration yet I have come to you with many issues concerning my status as a veteran no reply no help I have come to you many times with immigration. Some of you reply some of you ignore me, but those of you that reply is always the lie of we can’t help. We can’t intervene, which is false. Those states as a capitalist country you can bribe your way into the country. They wanna call it an investment visa, but that just means if you’re rich enough if you have the money you can buy your citizenship you can buy a visa you can buy a green card you just have to come up with I don’t know it’s somewhere between 400 and $600,000 and start a business. You can call it whatever you want but that’s a bribe if the average person can’t do the same because of lack of money then it’s no different than a bribe and it’s corrupt and I think half the problem is the media here in Vietnam doesn’t have to interview me talk to me or do anything and they can write news articles about me without ever speaking to me And I made the mistake of going on one of their television shows and they edited everything out to make it sound like I said something completely different than what I did and I don’t know if that’s impacting my immigration status I don’t know if immigration making me fly all the way to Buffalo New York from Hanoi Vietnam in the middle of Covid knowing I’d become homeless only to get fingerprinted costing me over $20,000 And keeping me separated from my family for over a year impacted it either. We have a perfectly normal marriage. I wear what I like to wear for TikTok. I like to wear what I want to wear to take my picture or sometimes go out I don’t wear to bed I take a shower my wife sees the exact same man she married, I don’t have to pick a side I can be trans fluid I’m still transgender if I’m gender nonconforming men can wear a dress and make up and not be in drag wake up people it’s 2022 in less than a week it will be 2023 and we still act less civilized Than certain times of the Roman empire or height of Greek society, or even after World War II and World War I, when men that had such severe injuries had operations to become women, and the media wrote very positive things about them. When did we become so hateful America what was it that split us into such a hateful country That I’m constantly considered an ignorant person when I mention I’m American when I’m abroad I hate having to say I’m Canadian which I also am this paid for my studies when I went to SUNY Plattsburgh I’d much rather be able to probably stay. I’m an American. That’s the country I fought for but automatically the word American around the world means idiot ignorant stupid hateful, a religious zealot no different than those in Saudi Arabia. I mean we literally get compared to Islamic extremists except were Christian extremists and I have to explain that that’s not how everybody is and I’ve been told so many times oh my gosh I’m shocked that you’re an American I assumed you weren’t. You’re a very rare. I’ve never met many Americans like you. You’re actually open minded and tolerant and realize that you’re not the center of the world well I wish everyone a merry Christmas and happy new year or just plain happy holidays if that’s what you go by.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I fought for my country through multiple wars. NVC at the US general consulate laughed at me and denied my marriage because I dressed the way I feel most comfortable and happy, after seeing the horror of war, death and destruction! They made jokes and made me cry, so despite becoming 100% disabled from a combat injury in defense of my country in the line of duty I  must dress how they say they want to see me. In a dress no one sees the combat veteran, the school teacher, the parent or spouse . I’m so disappointed in my government for telling other countries what to do when we don’t follow our own laws, executive orders or the constitution! I love my wife so much I’ll do any for her. I’m gender no conforming.

A lot of locals since COVID. we are in Ho Chi Minh City for one last chance at the United States Consulate, to prove that our marriage is real.

There are tropical beaches and it’s absolutely gorgeous. There are some places where there is quite a bit of garbage that’s washed up, but they do try and clean it up the best they can. I’ve been eating a lot of which taste completely different from the thaw I eat in the north up in Hanoi.

				<p class="card-body"> Here I am just having some fun wearing some Japanese Lolita style make up. I really like Lolita. And a lot of the younger generation here in Vietnam all recognized what I was wearing and loved it too. I took many pictures tonight with many people here in the lot. Thank you to all my friends that stopped and have pictures taken with me. Since it’s been raining a lot lately I haven’t been able to do much so I’ve just been practicing different forms of make up. I’m not trying to look Vietnamese, this is Japanese. It’s called Lolita. There are many different forms of Lolita I like sweet Lolita and this is as close as I can get to Sweet Lolita with what I have packed while I’m traveling. What do you think? I’m sure if you’re Vietnamese a lot of you were going to say it looks better if I’m not sure, but you don’t understand how many burns I have on my face how scarred it is and that I can’t wear make up like Vietnamese people girl I am Caucasian with completely different skin. It just wouldn’t work on me I’ve tried and I can’t do it. It just comes out. Terrible love everyone.

				<p class="card-body"> Happy birthday to my beautiful wife, my dad and my mom all born on the same day but because we live on the opposite side of the world, their birthdays were at different times. I’m so lucky to of met my beautiful wife, even if it took me traveling to the other side of the world. It’s so unfortunate that America has such lazy government workers that deny veterans at fault for countries, ability to bring their wife and family to the United States. What they’d rather do is bankrupt and kill veterans so they don’t have to pay them their benefits. It’s been raining here in the lot so I haven’t been able to do a lot today just for fun. I wore some Lolita make up and went live on the USA account. L Once again, happy birthday to my family all born on 20 November just different years mom and dad born on the same day, the month as my wife, my beautiful, beautiful wife, my beautiful, beautiful wife! #Vợ #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #travel #Vietnam #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgender #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory  #expat #livinginvietnam  #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #vietnamese #happybirthdaywifey #happybirthday (at Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/ClMYIf_OHDF/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I like flowers so I went to fresh garden today outside of the lot. They change what flowers they have depending on the season. Due to the climate being pretty constant in the lot many different types of fauna will grow here Đà Lạt. It seems that they have finished a lot of the renovations. the flowers of Dalat. I am at fresh garden here just outside the main city looking at all the beautiful horticulture. It’s absolutely amazing what they can do with the flowers in this part of Vietnam. Literally anything and everything will grow. And they change the flowers from season to season. It’s so beautiful  </p>
<p class="card-body"> unfortunate that I only had about two hours to spend there because it’s been taking me so long to get ready in the morning because my TV I just been giving me seizures has only been getting worse. But unfortunately as I was broke about before and NVC wants to see me die here in Vietnam rather than me get treatment in the United States by the VA. It was nice so many people recognized me and were so kind and they knew me from on television or from my tick-tock‘s and wanted pictures for about every one person that doesn’t like my make up because it never seen make up outside of Vietnam and don’t realize how plain and boring Vietnamese make up is to most of the world. I have no problem with Vietnamese make up it’s part of their culture it’s just is very plain and dull to Americans to Japanese to westerners to Koreans to Europeans to many people all over the world but that doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with it because we’re not in those countries were in Vietnam. But what I really truly hate is cis gendered women thinking that they can give me make up tips when they have Asian skin. I have Caucasian skin and I was born with the sex of a male well these are cis gendered Asian females telling a Caucasian transgender woman how to wear make up they have no idea how makeup would work on my skin first I have scarring from burns so I have very thick skin and the holes all throughout my Face. </p>
<p class="card-body"> And I’ve been doing these tick-tock‘s Shahab been trying to improve my make up skills I’ve only been doing this for one year I have no professional help for eight months I did it just looking at magazines in trial and error if you go back and look at my old pictures you can see how terrible it used to be. How long have you been putting make up on what gives you the right to make fun of me someone is trying to learn how to do something but has no help doesn’t have money to have somebody come and teach me and I’ve tried that before and like I said nobody in Vietnam knows how to deal with my type of skin David Muir that they don’t know what to do you don’t understand how many layers I have to use I have to use something that closes my pores I have to use a color corrector I have to use something that fills in the pores like a putty, There’s all these things the regular cis gendered Asian women doesn’t have to do because first of all she’s not really even wearing make up she’s just putting a little bit of foundation trying to look more Caucasian and putting a bright red lipstick it to me looks ridiculous. To me everybody looks exactly the same they have no eyeshadow they have nothing that makes them stand out and they look very plain and dull when they do use the make up. That’s why I love Japanese style make up and Korean style make up because it’s actually interesting it’s actually work of art it’s not just tapping a little bit of foundation on your eyes a little bit of foundation. You have completely different skin it’s like you own an electric hybrid Toyota and you’re trying to tell me how to fix my Peterbilt 18 wheeler they are nothing alike one is a gas hybrid battery engine car and the other is a giant diesel truck did you have nothing to do with each other yet you somehow think you’re an expert on the how other people skin is. and what really bothers is the hate comments when you keep saying teach him show him that is very hateful to say stop using Hoàng stop using and stop using Chú stop using all these male pronouns do you want me to start calling you a man if you’re a woman is that what you want me to do or would you correct me and be upset because from now on any woman that starts using that or any male that uses it I’m gonna call you The opposite gender of what you go by so if you look like a man just like a man I’m gonna start calling you ma’am and woman and use female pronouns if you think you’re a woman I’m gonna start calling you sir calling you and Hoàng and Châu how do you how do you like that do you not find that offensive that I think you look like a man. Because there are a lot of Vietnamese that look very feminine and could be a woman but they’re men there’s a lot of women that are very masculine and really look like they’re a man but they’re not and I don’t disrespect them by calling them the opposite of what they are. I had someone insult me a couple days ago saying teach him how to use make up and then I looked at their profile and they look like a man or make up was absolutely horrible and they have the nerve to tell me how do use my make up. Like I said for every one hater I get 999 compliments like I did today thank you everybody for making me feel great by asking for pictures by taking videos by talking to me, But just being kind people I need to remember those make fun of me those that are mean are people that hate their life or are secretly LGBTQ and are jealous that they can’t openly be LGBTQ the more you hate me for being transgender that means you’re attracted to me as transgender just like scientifically they prove in the more you’re homophobic you are the more gay you are. That’s just science and that’s how it works. So please stop being mean to me just because you’re attracted to me and you that makes you feel confused and all you know how to do is lash out and insult me. But science is proven every time you insult me you’re complementing me by telling me you find me extremely attractive so no way every time I get insulted I should be thanking the person because it means they’re actually </p>

Anyone that’s gone to university and I’m in a real university where the degree is actually accepted in more than one or two countries in the world, If you take in basic psychology it’ll teach you all this. This is one of the reasons why Vietnamese degrees are not excepted in 90% of the world because you don’t get a well-rounded education you just get told what do you think in the field that you’re going into you don’t have to take classes that have nothing to do with what you’ll be doing in the world if you don’t study art even though you’re going into math you’re not getting a well-rounded education you need to take classes that have nothing to do with what you’ll be doing in your life otherwise you can’t connect the dots and understand things on a macro level. Remain ignorant extremely ignorant in your ways because you don’t understand many things. This is why I want to bring my kids to the US to get an American degree so they’re not stark with an ignorant degree that many on Vietnamese unfortunately can’t afford to go to a good university in Vietnam and end up going to a school that doesn’t really teach him anything. I have asked so many students university students to defined the difference between communism and socialism and they can’t I’ve asked them to explain who Karl Marx is they can’t I’ve asked him to explain who angles is they can’t they don’t even know the birthday of the great president hold you mean they don’t even know where His speech for the debt for his declaration of independence came from they can’t even quote a single thing from it. So I have serious questions about the education system. I’m not blaming Vietnam I’m blaming the students like do they not think it’s important to understand these things in today’s world .  Capitalism has failed us communism was done the wrong way there must be a way to mix the two these are economic systems not political systems capitalism has completely destroyed the world and it’s sad to see the way people in Vietnam will poison their own people to make an extra dollar by putting shavings of the wall to make Bún I will sell poisonous tonics or completely lie about medicine Vietnam is it example of capitalism going absolutely crazy people have no concept of what it truly means. it’s sad how people need to try and fake having money. I’m gonna let you in a little secret people with money don’t let other people know they have money and when everybody in the country is wearing Gucci do you are and other name brands Westerners laugh at this because we know it’s all mark off and fake and it’s pathetic to do. Why do you need to pretend when it’s obvious you can’t this is a disgrace. In the west when people do this we joke about them we laugh at them we don’t like people showing off pretending that they have money yeah actually discuss a lot of people when they try and act like they’re all rich and all this and all that and what makes it worse is when it’s all completely fake why is it in Vietnamese culture it’s so important to lie to everybody everybody knows you’re lying everybody knows you’re cheating everyone knows you don’t have a happy family life yet you post these things as if it’s real. But everybody around you knows the truth I can’t say this is only in Vietnam this is the same in my country I just happen to live in Vietnam right now. If you want a world that your kids are gonna be able to live in and if you want your grandchildren to survive you need to start changing your ways now you can’t keep being wasteful you can’t keep buy </p>

Plastic does not deteriorate I see so many people just throw garbage out the window as if it’s no big deal you can’t just throw things on the ground I’ve gone to some of the most beautiful places in Vietnam only food to be full of trash because people just throw the garbage everywhere not understanding that it’s going to be there for 1000 years and every year you pile it up pile it up it gets worse and worse other countries have taken action against us again I have seen how so many other countries have had the return of the tourist industry Vietnam has not had the return of the of the tourist industry. People are staying away from Vietnam people don’t trust the alarm at the moment that needs to change I love this country please please stop </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I feel so betrayed by my country. I’ve had no help from anyone in Congress for 12 years. I’ve been fighting the military stealing money from me for 10 years I’ve been trying to get them to return insurance on my ex-wife I don’t even qualify to have they keep taking out of my pay￼. when I was in a VA hospital and got raped I got absolutely no therapy no help they just brought shit under the rug and act as if it never happened even let the employee quit. And now the final straw is NVC not allowing me to take my wife and children to the United States they been taking care of me for five years. They let people that only talks once a month over Skype come into the country. Something has to be done about the corruption at the US general consulate in Ho Chi Minh City. There must be corruption people must be taking bribes there’s no way so many people that I absolutely know are fake marriages got approved . while our completely legitimate real marriage was denied. I’m still upset that they will not give me any forms they complain about the trans phobic homophobic and pretty much racist jokes that they made against me and my family. I’m totally disgusted at how my country treats its veterans. Once you’re disabled and you can’t fight for them anymore￼. Has anyone ever wondered why we get such terrible service at the VA it’s because they don’t want us to get better they just want us to die. I’m so confused on who or what I am I received no guidance from the VA bylaw they’re supposed to have a coordinator that supposed to help me deal with these problems but I got nothing zero zilch no help.￼  </p>
<p class="card-body"> I have brain damage from a TBI I can always advocate for myself knowing what is available and what is it I saw people time and time again that you were exactly how to work the system and got everything they needed why was just constantly ignored. I’m starting to realize I almost feel like a German growing up in the 30s thinking that my country is so great only to find out that there’s a big lie behind it￼. I don’t think the comparison is fair we’re just not committing genocide within our own borders but we’ve committed genocide in the past and the natives to own the country we took were committing genocide in other lands we’re having secret wars private drone strikes we’re having all sorts of wars the public doesn’t even know about.￼ I love my country but the way betrays soldiers Marines airman Air Force Coast Guard and sailors is absolutely unacceptable￼. I realize I’m never gonna be pretty I’m never gonna be beautiful I’m always gonna be that ugly person and the people point out and laugh at it it hurts so bad did the one thing I wanted to be more than anything in life I will never have opportunity to be￼. I’m teased I made fun of Điểm joked about these are government workers I’m talking about I could care less about the average citizen but that’s neither people who I am supposed to respect are supposed to uphold or constitution and they wipe their ass with the constitution. They ignore the American with disabilities act they make fun of disabled veterans. This is who’s in charge of many of our government agencies. I’m sure there are great people out there but I haven’t met any of them where are they all.￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> Where are you said you’re a Bernie Sanders came to visit us in Kabul Afghanistan in 2010 and made a promise to every single Vermont soldier that if we needed help that you’d be there to help us do anything related from what might happen in that war. You were nowhere to be found when I was released and put onto the street for Madigan. You were nowhere to be found when I had uncontrollable seizures from my TBI and that I can just wanted to open up beds for active duty army you were nowhere to be found when they siphoned off money￼ did I don’t know the army they Omie far more but they cut $500 from my pay every month for absolutely no reason and they waited over 12 years to start doing it. where were you when my G.I. Bill got/100% to 50% because they don’t count wounded soldiers recovering in the hospital is earning time towards the G.I. Bill there’s title 10 and there’s title 10 eight till 10 AM is when you’re in a hospital unconscious unable to do anything recovering from a combat injury.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> I’ve been writing your office now for over 10 years no reply same with my senators and congressmen in New York when I was a resident there and same with my congressman and senators in Hawaii I have heard nothing from you for the past years. Do you or do you not support veterans do you or do you not support the LGBTQ community because it’s far as I can see you do not support us. I really like flowers so I spent the day at fresh garden ocean say day one hour it takes me over 10 hours to get ready I get up at 4 AM and my brain is so much of mush I can’t find things for eight hours it takes me an hour to find a sock and hour to find underwear hour to find something that matches our to find a toothbrush I put everything out the night before and somehow everything just disappears at night. My life is a living hell. I thought our case was a slam dunk we’d be in the US in no time I could never imagine that we’d have a perverted worker asking my daughter such sick disgusting questions expecting a seven-year-old to know exact dates not looking at our evidence not taking one bit into consideration like every other worker was doing this person was the typical fat lazy government worker that did not want to do their job denied their name denied getting a supervisor and denied me paperwork to report them and denied recognizing the American with disability act so I am now stuck paying for a place in the United States and Vietnam as my health deteriorates￼ . I’ve been forced to be on the run for weeks now ever since newspapers wrote articles without my permission without asking me a single question we agreed to go on a couple shows when one of them completely lied about what the show is about we have had people that hate us want to kill us and threaten to hurt my kids and threaten to kill me I threaten to kill my wife has threatened to burn us alive in our house and only by me leaving Did these leave my family alone. So I basically have to live in hiding so that I don’t get my family killed or myself killed it is my government help me hell no we’re basically refugees we’ve been married for over three years together for five years military dependence for three years but the government doesn’t give a shit they would rather approve people that met on the Internet never once met in person￼. please tell me how the hell does that happen why is the other workers did their job and we got the one fat slob that refused to do any work and he knew he was breaking the law or he would’ve given his name or some sort of identification number but he refused all of it but he pretended he couldn’t hear me as I kept asking for the paperwork to be explained to me and I showed him documented disability I need someone to go over paperwork with me he just wanted to gobble down his lunch because all he was interested was eating and getting fatter it’s obvious that this worker is just putting in their time to retire and don’t give a shit about Americans. You want to know why our immigration system is broken while we have so many illegals coming it’s because the legal way is broken </p>
<p class="card-body"> So you want to know why the immigration system is broken is because legal immigration is impossible if the best of the best can’t get their spouses or family and then of course those with even minor in fractions it’s pointless for them to even try it’s a 33 year wait if you’re in Mexico most people would be dead if they waited that long and their children would age out. My family has earned the G.I. Bill I gave blood for and took blood for for this country but they don’t want my family to be able to use the G.I. Bill that I earned for them. They are praying I die here in Vietnam. I have news if they deny our final appeal I am all set already I am going to fight in Ukraine and I will make it so freaking public that I’m doing this to prove that it’s a legitimate marriage I love my wife the other option was to pour gasoline on myself and burn myself the way the Buddhist did the protest the Vietnam war. but I prefer not to die by being burned to death that’s one of the most painful ways to go and what does it serve at least if I fight Ukraine I’m doing what I know best and I’m helping a western democracy that’s been invaded fight off an enemy there I feel perfectly at home in a uniform I don’t care how I look it’s war time not peacetime I dress the way I dress because it’s peacetime and I don’t want to turn into the person I was when I had to fight in war. But I will turn right back into that monster and I will rip through the enemy like you wouldn’t believe. I will chronicle every bit of it until the state my mission is defined at workers name I’ll get that person fired I have talk to so many lawyers and they broke so many laws they should be terminated immediately you know who you are worker at window 19 on November 1 serve in 2005 you know exactly who you are and you know all the lies you broke and how you wiped yourself with the constitution and ignore the American with disabilities act refused to give your name made trans phobic jokes let other workers make jokes didn’t correct them didn’t do your job concentrated on little children asking them exact dates it would be impossible for them to know considering they weren’t living with us at the time you never even asked him where are you living With them at the time you never asked a single question that made any sense you asked him questions they had no idea how to answer they don’t speak your Dutch southern dialect you ask them you used words that they’ve never heard of in their whole life did no idea what the hell you were talking about. Every single place I go people know who I am and know about my wife and know that we have a real marriage all of Vietnam knows this how is it that this worker has been under a rock and knows nothing and couldn’t lift his finger to look at a single piece of evidence do you even Google to see how many newspapers have written about us how many television shows of written about us how long we’ve been together we’ve been on the news as a couple since 2019 and we were on the news when Donald Trump came we have been seen as a couple and been recognized as a married couple by multiple government agencies just because you think you’re on some sort of power trip that’s all it was was you must have a shitty life. So what are you do you destroy true love whenever you see someone that truly loves each other you want to destroy it because you hate what you will never have you will die alone with nobody that loves you and you hate that so you try and ruin everybody else’s life. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s not easy being me. I’m so scared the country I fought for may deny  me my wife and children to the USA again. It’s been 5 years. In the USA we would be common law married in most states. They are military dependents. . This is how people becom radicalized I don’t even know who I am. People act as if I have all the answers and know what I’m supposed to be who I’m supposed to be all while battling demons such as depression PTSD the horrific trauma that happened to me against my will.￼ I try so hard every day I’m not like a normal person or a life just comes easy every day life hurts is so painful I don’t just mean that as a metaphor I mean that literally physically hurts to breathe it hurts to walk my head is in a constant state of headache. I’m constantly dealing with people that expect way too much for me some days I don’t even know why I do the things I do like I’ve ended up losing so much so much in the past few years at this point I have nothing to my name I owe close to half $1 million at this point I’ll never be able to pay that back my interest alone each month￼ is close to 25% of my income another 50% go to the child support and then another 25% I don’t get to keep I literally live off of a few hundred dollars a month. And when I hear that I’m have living the dream no I’m not I try and put on a happy face. People say fake it till you make it. And that’s all I’m trying to do. </p>
<p class="card-body"> There’s so many ignorant people in this world that think I have a choice of who I am when I have no control whatsoever of how old is born. All I know is how bitter and angry I was for years and I’m a little less better but I’ve lost all the happiness I had that I had work so hard for it’s all gone it’s all been stolen from me taken from me by people that just wanna put me down, hurt me, play me, make fun of me￼. Being a white Anglo-Saxon male I have no idea how hateful the world was and it’s been a huge shock this past year of learning just how messed up this planet is how hard it is to just be who you are. The world is full of fake disgusting people that think it’s OK to lie to be dishonest￼. what is wrong with people thinking it’s OK to hurt other people some people just have no culture I never thought I’d say this there’s a lot about religion I don’t agree with but at least spirituality some sort of religious foundation at least teaches people right from wrong which it seems so many people in this world have no idea. I am hurting so much and I’m in a country that I literally have no help from. I have no access to veterans hospital no access to the medication they gave me no access to a therapist no access to anybody to help guide me through literal changes that are only a year old. I’m going through everything alone and I say alone because no one reads material to help me no one takes the time to read the most basic and simple pamphlets to help with what I’m going through to help understand what clinical depression is tell understand what it means to be gender nonconforming I just am judged constantly but ignorant ignorant people. my natural state of being was a soldier that’s all I know how to do and with winter setting in crane needs foreign volunteers more than anything else I seriously question why why don’t I just don’t know what I’m used to go back to what I know how to do. I had no problem wearing a uniform or uniform is the one thing I could wear because everyone wore the same uniform man woman non-binary we all wore the same uniform we all fall together as a team I’m no longer part of a team I’m just alone just completely alone i’m alone doesn’t mean you can be right next to somebody but if they don’t understand you they don’t read about the problems you go through you’re still alone alone has nothing to do with how close you are to someone else or if you’re next to someone else or if you’re in the same room as someone else you can still be completely alone. And there’s only so many times you can give trust to the public. I have no one in the whole world that I can say I completely trust there’s no one that I’ve ever met that I’ve told something to or done something and then told something and having found out later it was a lie at least once so I’m stuck with my demons with my secrets or the things that hurt￼ alone. And it just hurts so much it’s so easy to read what clinical depression is my brain doesn’t work like other peoples brains some of the most famous people in the world suffered from severe depression and growling Paul so many other artists can go at the moment I can think of better examples but there are much better examples. What people don’t understand is depression is like constantly being hit by a train run over over and over again having impending feelings of doom as if your whole family has just been killed that is how terrible depression can be unless you suffer from it in the most severe ways you have no idea what I’m talking about we’re not talking about the occasional blues we’re talking about severe clinical depression.￼ and the only thing that relieves the smalls that is nature I can’t be in the city and function no one seems to get that no one seems to understand I can’t function in heat and pollution and stench which is all the noise is is greatest noise is the visit it’s not someplace I can live I thought I would be in Hanoi to three years tops not five years all because of my stupid effing gov#Вьетнам #вьетнамскиефлешбеки #вьетнамскаякухня #вьетнамский #далат #далатоа #далателефон  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Traveling as a transgender woman can  turn extremely dangerous very fast when extremely uneducated and ignorant hateful people cross your path. Overall Vietnam is a very safe country but be warned there are extremely ignorant hateful people prepared to use violence or at the very least spit in your face￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> I had a mostly good day I got off to a late start and went to the night market  Dalat . Everything was going great so many people were nice offered me samples of their food and I bought a lot of different food and video that one lady just couldn’t stand that I didn’t want to buy her food and she came out screaming and yelling all sorts of slurs. I know enough Vietnamese to understand when somebody is calling me terrible names.￼ except for this one crazy woman whose picture you can see everybody else in the lot was wonderful to me. Everything was so delicious the avocado ice cream the Dalat pizza the cheese yogurt the barbecue squid the giant chicken wings and all the seafood I also bought many different attachments for my hair to look very pretty. Overall I had a wonderful time at the Gilot night market and I’m not gonna let one crazy woman ruin it for me. everywhere you go you have hateful people unfortunately some other western nurse came up to me and said they were so sorry and they were never going to visit that night market again out of fear the other people may act as crazy as that woman. When you see people acting crazy towards Taurus you need to say something and stop these people this is why countries like Thailand , Laos , Cambodia and Singapore have tons of foreigners and in Vietnam there are  very little few compared to these countries . I have visited all these countries and there are so many Westerners. I feel sad because I love Vietnam so much but some bad people are making   Vietnam seem like a bad place to visit and  there’s been so much negative publicity in the news in the west about Vietnam and how dangerous it is for the LGBTQ community many people is choosing to stay away. Just because the foreigner isn’t LGBTQ doesn’t mean they’re gonna come to a country where people act hateful. If you want the tourists to return you need to teach the people that are hateful the it’s unacceptable in the world today to act that way. This lady spit in my face and that’s completely unacceptable th o do to a guest  in  your country. The lady selling yogurt and avocado ice cream is so nice and so sweet I really hope if you go to the night market you buy some of her products she was such a sweet lady and so kind and I feel so bad that the lady behind her was so mean and rude towards her all because I had gotten food from this one lady and was eating it where I had bought it from.￼ #nightmarket </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am in Dalat because it reminds me of home and my health is deteriorated so much living in Hanoi. But I do it because I love my wife and children so much in Hanoi. Yet the USCIS won’t look at any evidence to see how difficult it is on me to live in Vietnam and that you would only do it if you truly love somebody to spend five years in a city that literally destroys your body. I’ve had my lungs burned my body burned suffered severe injuries in combat yet￼ did USCIS give a crap no because they don’t care about veterans. So I am in the lot trying to remind me of Home breathe and some fresh air trying to recover from my severe severe depression from my government that I served for 15 years with honor called me a liar told me I had a fake marriage that wasn’t a bona fide marriage. Don’t serve in the US military it gets you nowhere he gets you called a liar get it basically they told me I’m a felon it’s a felony to do what they’re accusing me of. Do you know what a kick between the legs that is it’s either that or they’re racist they don’t like mixed couples that are homophobic and trans phobic. I couldn’t believe how many people that had never met their spouse got approved and because my kids couldn’t remember exact dates from five years ago￼. They have no idea about my wife and I sex life that’s not children’s business. They have no idea the exact date I moved in because I rented the apartment directly next-door to our house because you don’t live together because you’re married. They seem to of forgotten Covid happened. If these people read the news or did any work that they’re supposed to do instead of being lazy fat Ephors just worried about gobbling their lunch down and I actually didn’t work maybe your immigration would be so broken.￼ So I went to Datanla Waterfall to try and stop me out of this depression. People don’t understand how much it hurts to give you are practically your life for your country. I am 100% disabled due to the injuries I suffer in Afghanistan for my country. And my country turns around and pisses in my face. What other country treats their veterans so horrible as the United States does. My family are military dependents and have been for three years. But did this that Effer give a crap no he was lazy he wanted nothing to do with his job. Gave me a piece of paper asking for all the information that we have already turned in given to them uploaded and brought to them. So this just proves how incompetent are immigration system is and how much or I should say how little our government cares about veterans. Giving us one day of free meals is that really the best you can do you give us broken healthcare you underfunded VA you pay is 12:4520 of what many of us would be making in the civilian world is based on her education do you do nothing but show your how little you care about those that supposedly are defending our country. 0 Sure your way the flag for us while we’re able-bodied in your military, but as soon as we become injured and become useless to you and we’re just POS is that you just don’t even care about. I didn’t get any help from immigration. Despite Joe Biden‘s executive order despite the American with disability act despite being 100% permanent and totally disabled from a combat injury USCIS is giving me absolutely no help whatsoever. I can’t explain how upset I am that the woman I love I can’t take home with me yet. And the government just wants to completely bankrupt me. They’re already stealing money from me from when I wasn’t getting paid and I was just earning retirement points that have no cash value and are siphoning to $10,000 out of my pension And now they’re costing me my whole life savings my house my car my inheritance everything I own from my family. Who would do this for a fake marriage. This is how stupid that lazy man is it was at window 19 and November 1 serving number 2005. Lazy lazy lazy incompetent government worker. Thank goodness for the Dilot it reminds me so much of the Adirondacks where I grew up. I don’t know what I would do if I could recuperate for a little bit </p>
<p class="card-body"> here while my wife’s being punished for being married to me and being sent away to universities far from my house so I wouldn’t want to be alone in Hanoi at least Here in the lot I can feel I’m home again and pray to God every day that a miracle will happen and somebody will read this somebody will help this disabled veteran get their family to the United States and realize how broken our system is and how lazy some of our government employees are, just counting the days down till they can retire and get even fatter and lazier than they already are I saw so many good workers actually doing their job looking at evidence why was it that our agent was only interested in sexual perverted questions of a 12 year old girl from when she was seven years old speaking in a dialect that she could not understand we are from Hanoi Ho Chi Minh City speaks a different dialect they even have different words we tried to explain she has no idea what you’re saying she has no idea the exact dates of things she saw me at the house all the time because I lived practically next door why are you asking so stupid questions to a child that’s not even of age to be asking these questions too. If you use your brain for half a second you realize if this was fake we would’ve coached our children and told them exactly what to say but stupid I thought being honest was the best policy but it’s obvious you need to lie to immigration you need to come up with stories and coach your children even though it tells you not to. Because if you don’t tell your kids exactly what to say you’ll be denied. And when I brought up the executive of Joe Biden he basically had the smirk of her not my president people like that don’t belong working for the government you can have your opinion at home but don’t bring it to work and you certainly don’t make fun of our commander-in-chief while on duty working. I am just so disgusted in how terrible that counselor worker was. Here is the beautiful pictures of the waterfall I went to </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent a few hours at the crazy house here in Dalat 🇻🇳. One of my favorite places to go. I was upset because everything I had typed under my phone when I went to transfer it through Word onto my computer I couldn’t prove who I was and it all got deleted so I need to completely restart it. If you’re ever in the lot make sure to make a stop at the crazy house it’s much much larger than it looks you can spend days wandering through there.￼ The craziness of the crazy house reminds me of how crazy my country in the United States is so many people are just so ignorant and think that because they were raised in the one religion that there is one way of doing things the American way is the only way to do things the hate that I receive from part of the United States is scary it’s amazing how people want the second amendment respected yet they deny me my first amendment right to express myself in any way I want. or how they say they support veterans until they find out as a veteran of color a gay veteran or a transgender veteran or someone else they don’t like are they much is a oh I’m not racist I just don’t like such a massage. Hey is hate if you hate one of us you’re a hateful person it doesn’t matter you can’t say oh I OK with these people but I hate those people doesn’t work that way you’re either a true American that supports our veterans are you don’t support any of our veterans you don’t get to pick and choose which ones unless the dirtbag ones that aren’t really veterans that have dishonorable discharge is and didn’t have PTSD or something that caused them to get one where they can get an upgrade. You are just a hypocrite. And some and everyone that uses the Bible or religion against me I don’t think it’s ever actually read more than one Bible we have no idea what the verses actually mean they have never read it I think more than just one version and I guarantee you they’ve never translated older Bibles from one language to another to try and get a better understanding of what words mean. How ignorance is just everywhere but I wasn’t expecting it to be so dominant in my own country￼. why do people fault me for not knowing who I am what I am what I want do you know everything about yourself? I’m sorry I’m not the perfect person that knows everything about myself I’m still learning so much is happened in such a short period of time that I can’t just say I’m an expert on who I am and what I want and what it means to be transgender I have no idea. I just know what makes me feel more comfortable what makes me happy. Why are there so many jealous people that just hate the fact that I found a way to be happy. That I have found a way to deal with my PTSD. That I have found a way to deal with my grief and depression. That I have found a way to go on living. It’s jealousy it’s no more than pure jealousy because they hate their lives they have to try and destroy mine but I’ve got news for them it’s not gonna work I do what makes me happy and I’m not gonna let other people insult the fact me.￼ how quickly I was a Marine and a soldier how quickly people forget the motto of the Marine Corps how quickly people forget the army values it’s obviously they don’t still carry them with them if they’re out of the military and some that still are obviously don’t live by them. Could you member what it means doing the right thing when no one‘s looking what integrity means do you have integrity or do you just fake it. Because when you insert a veteran call a veteran stolen valor a veteran that not only spilled her own blood but spilled others blood in the name of America and you have the audaciousness to call me a liar when you don’t even take the time to look through my profile and see me and Afghanistan to see me driving in convoys to see me earning my blue chords￼. this is why you’re so easily brainwashed you do no research of your own you just go by what one person tells you or what you think in your head and fax me nothing you listen to one source not multiple sources you don’t care about citations are facts and things are just automatical </p>
<p class="card-body"> are facts and things are just automatically true because you believe that it’s true. I’m sorry you flunked out of either junior high high school university and don’t understand how importing citations are a reading pure reviewed articles you can’t just read get your news from entertainment shows fox is an entertainment show it’s not a news program look it up they leave it admitted it themselves. And don’t accuse me of being a CNN lover either. All corporate news. I try and get my news from all over the world. But the greatest slap in the face is still the US consulate in Ho Chi Minh city being completely transform back into American and violating my constitutional rights I am still working on finding out that workers name I will not rest until that worker is reprimanded and re-trained to learn how to be a proper worker or they need to fire her lazy fat ass is like him. Hi love my wife. And since when did marriage even have anything to do with love for the longest time is been arranged marriages there’s been marriage of convenience to bring families together so what exactly are they asking for this is an actual bona fide marriage out of love I mean I am in American I can marry whoever I want for whatever reason I want as long as it’s legal and we’re not the same sex couple. We’ve been together for five years married for over three I mean the odd I just can’t believe how insulting the worker we got was and how lazy he was all he wanted to do is gobble down his lunch rather than actually look at any evidence again our immigration system is broken because a fat lazy ass has like him he is the reason people cross the border illegally he is the reason that goes through my head. Why should I wait six or seven or eight years to bring my family legally to America when they claim they put military and veterans first my family who are military dependence why is it that we allow people to cross the border illegally do you know why because it’s impossible to do it the legal way it’s absolutely impossible give me so many mistakes this caused me I was at this point over $100,000. That is how incompetent our US immigration system is again remember I’ve told you they flew me from Hanoi to Buffalo why I should say I feel myself costing me quite a bit of money because it was during Covid only for fingerprints which they could’ve done in Vietnam which then led me to being locked out of the country and horrific things happening to me in America. All because immigration is incompetent it hires the most lazy people I’ve ever met I have written them over and over again that I did not live in the United States and they said they understood that and it’s obviously that they didn’t because they forced me to go to the United States with absolutely no one that lives in a foreign country what is the other side of the world during a pandemic just to have your fingers printed they love you homeless for years stranded and they still won’t expedite my case and thought they denied it what is it gonna take to fix the immigration system what is it gonna take like for legal American born or American citizens however you got it to be able to bring your family over people it’s just green cards there’s never met their spouse got approved so how is it it was because they’re trans phobic and they were anti-President Biden that’s why this person has no business being in immigration he has no business working in the consulate is it that Louisiana’s needs to be terminated ASAP </p>

				<p class="card-body"> After a long day of writing , I finally took a break and went to 3-D world. I was planning on going to the lake but the sunsets so early here by the time I finally got ready it was 4:30 PM and the sun already had begun to set by 5 o’clock it was dark. So I decided I’d have a cheeseburger to remind me of America and then I have some fun in 3-D world which is open till 10 PM￼. Today was the first day that I didn’t have anybody target me with head so I’m happy for that it was very upsetting having so many people lie about me at the market that I almost decided to never go there again. Even though the majority of the lot are super wonderful people it only takes one or 2% of the population to destroy the name of the city forever. So I encourage those hear people say terrible things￼,  </p>
<p class="card-body"> To remind them that they’re committing sedition they’re basically going against what the government says is fact and here in Vietnam that something that’s not tolerated you can’t publicly go online and called the Vietnamese government liars and the health ministers has said that being transgender is not a mental illness so when you publicly lie and call me mentally ill Sam a prostitute and badmouth me there or criminal consequences to that￼. Everybody’s phone is tracked and so far I don’t know why it’s some grab drivers they are involved in it but they are I think it’s because one of them got a bad review for refusing to pick me up but if you’re going to be trans phobic and refuse to pick me up I’m not gonna give you a five star rating I’m gonna give you a one star rating as you deserve￼. how would you like it if you visited America and just because you were Vietnamese people are racist against you and refused to serve you any food refused to let you have a motel refused to give you anything all because of the color of your skin racism homophobia and transphobia they’re all the same. #3Dworldđàlạt #3dworlddalat #tayhotrish🇻🇳🏳️‍⚧️ #transpride #loveyourself #fyp #fupシ  #lgbtvietnam #xuhuong2022tiktok❤️🌈  #xuhuong2022🏳️‍🌈  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent most of the day writing a timeline for immigration that has absolutely no bearing on whether a marriage is real or not. This is a perfect example of why our immigration system is broken. Because we have fat lazy pieces of scum that work in immigration they don’t care anything about the people they’re supposed to be serving except for when their next lunch break is or smoke break.￼ i’m still upset the trans phobic jokes the agent made and how he had total disregard for veterans he must’ve been too fat to make it into the military or too scared to even try because it was war time and he must hate his life because he’s an ugly fat overweight balding men that just asked the most perverted questions what gets him off his asking disgusting questions of little girls which is what he did. how do you prove love everyone in the country knows I love my wife and my wife loves me but this person was just too lazy to look at any evidence and it upsets me but yet again my government has just throwing me away after using me as a soldier. Once I became disabled I was worthless to them and I just became a burden where they hope I die they don’t wanna have to pay all the benefits to my children going to school they don’t want to have me get help at the VA they want to see me self-destruct. Is totally insane The standards they have if this was a fake marriage my kids would’ve been coached and known every single answer is it to every question they would’ve known dates they would’ve known when we consummated our marriage which is a perverted question to ask a little girl. But this is a real marriage where we just let the kids answer honestly we thought that was the best thing to do was be honest but obviously since our in our legal immigration is so broken you’re forced to lie make things up in order to get into the country because all the people that lied passed we knew people specifically that went there and they were approved yet me and my wife the exact perfect example of a true love story a true love marriage was denied. All because of this trans phobic person if he’s trans phobic he’s probably homophobic and probably racist he probably supports the clan for all I know the way he laughed at me made jokes refused to give his name and just was completely insulting disgrace is the great country I was born into. I am just still so disappointed that I love my wife so much and I spilled my own blood and spilled the blood of the enemy in Afghanistan on the name of my own country only to have my own country spit in my face and deny me having my family who I’ve been with for five years entry into the country where they’ve allowed people that have known each other for three months entrance into the country. this is why people cross the border illegally it’s because the legal way is impossible to be an honest person you are punished to do things the correct way you are punished. I hate how broken a system our immigration system is for those legally trying to do the right thing for those that listen to the rules that say don’t coach your children don’t tell people what to say so how would a six-year-old know exact dates how would a little girl know these things in Vietnamese culture these things are not talked about this person was a complete idiot that has no concept of Hanoi culture he lives in Saigon Ho Chi Minh City in Hanoi are two very different cities with two very different cultures. If this person had any education whatsoever he’d know you don’t talk to your kids about your sex life yet he continue to ask these perverted questions. And asking if I’m sleeping in bed with my wife. And the way the southern accent came out to what my daughter heard she took it as something very embarrassing to talk about she was terrified of these people she was alone with just her brother with no parental supervision asked questions that she has never heard of in her life.

<p class="card-body">  marriage must be fake purely based on me rejecting gender stereotypes. This man who is trans phobic he needs to be re-educated or fired I have stated this so many times totally totally disgust me. Our marriage never should’ve been denied especially with the military recognizing it for three years so many government agencies did background checks and recognize it as a legitimate marriage because it is a legitimate marriage. Why would we make this up why what did we have to gain from making this up I lost so much money trying to get home to my wife and kids because stupid immigration sent me from Hanoi to Buffalo New York for fingerprints during Covid they constantly have screwed up our case and constantly made mistakes and this is yet another example of the incompetence of the US CIS and especially the Ho Chi Minh City consulate. This worker was so incompetent the exact reason we hate government workers that are lazy and do nothing but leech off of our tax dollars he forgets he works for me I don’t work for him and for him to refuse every single one of my rights is a disgrace to the agency. I can’t believe he refused to give his name and they refused to give me paperwork to fill out for discrimination complaint￼ do US consulate in Ho Chi Minh city is broken or at least this one man should not have a job in our government he is a leech a lazy lazy leech the paper he gave us he had all of the information but was too lazy to look at it because he was too concerned about eating his lunch and getting fatter </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent a beautiful day at Cam Lý waterfall here in Da Lat Vietnam 🇻🇳 . It looks like it was gonna rain most of the day but it didn’t. It was very cold for Vietnam but the waterfall was absolutely beautiful. The last time I visited that there was a thunderstorm and I got flooded out and had to wait for hours for the water to go down. I plan on visit in there again because of the pure beauty of the area. There are flowers from all over the world that grow there because of the temperature stays consistent Lee cool not too hot not too cold. I highly recommend visiting Cam Lý waterfall. #CamLyWaterfall #tháccamly  #ĐàLạt #ĐàLạt🏳️‍⚧️ #ĐàLạt🏳️‍🌈 #ĐàLạt2022 #đàlạt2022❤️❤️❤️ #dalat #dalat🏳️‍⚧️ #dalat🏳️‍🌈 #dalat2022 #dalat2022❤️ #lolita #lolita🏳️‍⚧️ #translolita #xuhuong2022tiktok❤️🌈  #xuhuong2022🏳️‍🌈   #xuhuong2022🏳️‍⚧️   #xuhuong2023 #fypシ #fyp🇻🇳#waterfall #xuhuongtiktokk #xuhuonglgbt🏳️‍🌈 #xuhuong🍀 #xuhuong😈 #LâmĐồng #cungtiktok #camly #vietnam (at Cam Ly Waterfall) https://www.instagram.com/p/CklRC5xucJV/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had another great day in the lot I went to the lake and I went to the Friday night market and people were still so kind to me a lot of people asked for pictures and they were wonderful. But there are still ignorant uneducated uncultured people that like to destroy their name and disrespect their ancestors they’re basically trash. Most people on the lot a wonderful but nobody is speaking up against these trashy people they are the lowest of the low class the uneducated the type of people that live in barns and sleep with animals. Please I beg you to lie I don’t wanna have to give you the negative seal where you will be boycotted and you will have an Asterix on all travel blogs all travel magazines in on all Internet sites warning people that this is a dangerous city dangerous and that people will lie about you and destroy your name and could cost you lots of money and lots of jobs it’s not worth the risk￼. I love the lot and I love the people so much that I’m so sad I’m gonna have to tell people all the foreigners all the western earth never to come here that delight needs tourist and they’re not gonna get them people will skip over the city just because people don’t look like me or act like me doesn’t mean they’re going to come here because they’re different they will support me and boycott your city that’s what you don’t understand you need to￼ tell people that are even older than you it’s not disrespectful to call trashy people and ignorant liars not to destroy the name of the lot. In the lots name is being destroyed all over the Internet it’s being called the city of hate the Vietnamese city of discrimination the place to avoid at all costs don’t allow this to continue. There are now eight days left to change this. Please write TikTok and explain that there are hateful ignorant people in this city that most of the people are wonderful people but the minority of people bad people are destroying the Dalats name the lot has a terrible reputation now if you Google the law and boycott you will see it that many westerns are canceling their vacation to Dalat  over this. This is a very serious matter when you lie￼, Bad mouth, and slander somebody. Not only is  this a law  a law but you can be fined and put in jail how many people are going to be able to afford the 30 million dong fine for bad mouthing me. You are not anonymous when you make the report I find out who you are I will get your name I will get the connection to the phone or computer that that lied and called me a prostitute said I was naked at the market said I did sexual acts and said I was basically doing pornographic material of the night market these are all total lies you can go to jail for lying so severely you can lose all of your money your name will be public bringing dhsnevtonyiurvfsmikybsnd ancestors as a piece of trash liar , your house can be confiscated please stop lying you’re only hurting yourself and hurting the city of dalat.￼ i’m not gonna warn people again I’m going to enforce the law that’s been written that says you cannot lie about people publicly the Internet is public you may think you’re anonymous on TikTok but you’re not your name will be given in a criminal investigation would you have committed a crime so please Dalat  most of you I love and are  wonderful people stop the hateful people from lying about me or suffer the consequences of what happens to your city when all tourists stop coming here </p>
<p class="card-body"> Đà Lạt has become extremely hateful and extremely dangerous for the LGBTQ community. I am here on assignment to write for safe cities for the LGBTQ community to visit in those that support the LGBTQ community. As of right now I am going to be forced to say boycott DaLat , do not visit Dalat  because if people are willing to lie lose face and cause shame upon their family and ancestors they’re willing to do violence which makes the city  an unsafe city for foreigners. I will give it 10 days to see if the lies continue and if so I will be forced to write a very negative article that hundreds of millions of tourists read and explain to skip visiting Dalat at all cost in Thailand there are many many foreigners because they are not treated so horrible as I was treated last night at the night market. Even if the majority of the people are kind and sweet the few people that lie and post terrible things threatening my life lying calling me a prostitute saying I was naked and doing sexual acts. It may be unfair that very small percentage of people are destroying the businesses of most of Dalot but Westerners from America Canada Australia and Europe and other places will not visit a city that is hateful towards the LGBTQ community. It takes at least 100 people to have a video removed and it showed they were all from Da Lat.  This will affect the cities rating on Google and Travelocity on all the major travel sites on all the major travel blogs,  all of them will put the seal un safe for LGBTQ community it will not receive the stamp of approval to visit it will not be considered a  safe city it will be considered an unsafe city due to the lies and slander. Nobody will visit a city where they risk their  reputation being destroyed by people that have hate in their hearts. people here are not Catholic and don’t respect Jesus they are not Buddhist because they do not respect Buddha and they do not respect their ancestors they bring shame upon all three of them by their lies. When you report a lie online that is the same as publicly lying about somebody. This is an extremely shameful act in Vietnamese culture it shows you have no honor, no culture , no education,  are part of  the lowest of the low class. That you have no education and must’ve been raised with animals. That is how the a small percentage of the people of Dalat that reported me and lied are they are uneducated ignorant and hateful people. And the world will know that about DaLat.  I love you Da Lat most of the people  are wonderful but I’m sorry as long as there’s at least 100 people every day falsely lying about me online slandering my name breaking the law going against Vietnamese law I must report it and I must tell the truth to the world about how dangerous a city it is for the LGBTQ community. dangerous does not just mean being attacked it means having your name slandered or lied about. If people will lie about you it is a dangerous city to visit and I will have to put the boycott mark on Dalat which whenever anyone gets the pamphlet on Vietnam from the many different travel group such as Google Expedia Travelocity they will see the warning on Dalot  and why they should not visit and if they choose to visit be extremely careful as there are some very hateful people in the city. I am giving it 10 days to see if it changes please tell everyone you know if you love Dallas I do  and you want tourists to return also,  stop making up lies online to stop making false reports they are only going to hurt the business if you were wondering why you don’t see the hundreds of thousands of tourists that Thailand , Cambodia Laos , all have while Vietnam is loosing western tourists. how you were treating foreigners you were being very disrespectful. Weston or stick together.  If you call the LGBTQ community negative things you are calling all Westerners negative things and we stick together and we will boycott cities together so don’t think you’re just hurting the LGBTQ community you were keeping all foreigners from visiting your city I will put some pictures up of the false lies a </p>
<p class="card-body"> anyone that saw me the night market last night saw that I was not naked I was not a prostitute I was buying food I was enjoying the market I was taking pictures with people I was completely normal and Vietnamese law protects the transgender community so you were committing a hate crime you were being hateful why do you have such hate in your heart why are you bringing shame to your ancestors they can see you why are you disrespecting Jesus why are you disrespecting the Buddha. this is a very shameful act you should be very ashamed that there are people in the city of the lot that are such horrible terrible people to lie like this about a foreigner that is here to write about how great the lot was. Before all the negative comments and lies from last night I was prepared to do a full article on multiple newspapers multiple magazines and multiple travel sites on how you should visit the lot over all other cities and as I said now if things don’t change I will re-importing skipped a lot under no circumstances should any foreigner visit the lot even though the majority of the people are wonderful people so long as there are hateful people and the regular loving people do nothing to stop them. It’s not a city that should be rewarded with tourism it’s a city that needs to be punished by being boycotted boycotted means we skip over your city we drive through it we fly over it we do not visit that foreigners by the millions hundreds of millions will read this and many of them will not visit your city so long as these hateful people exist and are not told otherwise. Thy Will not be rewarded with tourism they will be punished by being boycotted so please if you love the lot the way I love the light when you hear people speak hate about me remind them that I have hundreds of millions of people that read what I write and they will read not to come here even if 99% is wonderful if you have 1% it is going online and calling me a prostitute saying I showed up naked to the night market lying completely causing shame on their family and their ancestors your city needs to be skipped over I’m sorry foreigners will not visit you you can thank them they hate for people of the lot for the drop in tourism you can thank them for why all the other countries around Vietnam their toys and is booming while in Vietnam foreigners will stop coming to  Dalat. #boycottdakst #dalatishateful #dalattrabsphibic #skipdalat  #dalatdestroyedmylife. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent the day at Lumpini park here in Bangkok Thailand. It reminded me of a miniature central park like in Manhattan. There was a nice beautiful lake with a river that went around it and all sorts of different buildings including an old clock tower. There was artwork all over the place and it made for a nice wide-open green space. Which is something that’s very difficult to find in Hanoi. I am in certain areas such as Tay Ho where I lived for a little bit it was full of parks in the green spaces￼. The area I live in now Minh Chi district is an urban jungle it’s nothing but concrete it remains hot day and night. The concrete absorbs all the heat during the day and just releases it all night. And the pollution has nowhere to go there’s no trees to absorb it and create oxygen says it very difficult for a Westerner like myself to breathe. I have breathing problems as it is at the extreme pollution of the area and it’s just￼ miserable for me. But hopefully it all goes well with the plan eventually will be back in the United States clean out the Pacific Northwest where I live now is the same as smoking three packs of cigarettes a day. So I used to smoke but if you smoke one pack that’s the same smoking four or five bucks that’s terrible. it’s in the top 10 for all sorts of cancers and I’m sure a lot of it has to do with all the chemicals Americans jobs on the country not to mention so much food comes from the Latin in the south were so much age and oranges used that people don’t understand that hard metals are absorbed by root vegetables. And are basically poisoning themselves. I know very little people that reach the age of 40 without having cancer. They don’t call it cancer unless you get really sick and die or almost die from it otherwise they just called a tumor. my wife has been a wonderful understanding wife that understands I just can’t stay where our houses all the time I need to get out to places such as the lot or Sapa where the air is clean otherwise I end up sick and paralyzing bad for weeks sometimes months and once you get into isolation mode of depression it’s very hard to get out of it but if you’re constantly on the move constantly doing something it’s a lot harder to get in that cycle of depression. I don’t know many other people would be as lucky as I am to have such an understanding and wonderful wife. She may not know everything because her cultures are so different but she does she can definitely see the difference in me when I travel to places like Sapa or the lot she can see my health is vastly improved and when I am in Hanoi for a long period of time she sees how sick I got. Most recently my lupus came back my whole lymphatic system backed up completely swelled up and every major lymph node had to be cut open and drained.￼ I went to the hospital the first time thinking it was just a spider bite but I don’t like how they didn’t give me any stitches and left me with a giant hole in my arm so I ended up doing surgery on myself for the rest of them without any anesthesia without any painkillers and it hurt but in the end the pain went away really fast. Every day I was in severe severe pain from the lymph nodes being so swollen they were swollen at my groin￼, Under my throat, and under my armpits for the largest where I have multiple lymph nodes swollen once I had poked holes in them drain them got an all the fluid all the paws and clean them out very well and the swelling went down my health improved quite a bit￼. I’m going in the hospital it hurt horribly what they did do you like his job some shots in the number a little bit and then just suck everything out and just hold it out like they don’t understand Caucasians are much bigger than Asians are you with require far more anesthesia far more numbing agent and I have the red hair gene which means it disappears very quickly￼. A dentist in believe me about the red hair gene and how anesthesia and pain killers wear off extremely fast because of that gene and thought I was just making it up until they write in a peer review dental magazine that it’s it’s a </p>
<p class="card-body"> they read in a peer review dental magazine that it’s it’s a fact you you if you have red hair or the gene for it you need anywhere from 2 to 5 times the anesthesia and painkiller to have the same effects as someone without the gene and it needs to be given over and over again because of how quickly it wears out anyways I’ve been in Bangkok and it’s been quite a good experience except for that I was robbed twice and I got extremely ill a couple times arm but I feel quite a following very fast I really appreciate my fans here in Thailand. I think it’s because historically that they’ve had multiple types of transgender men and women they have specific men and women that are only attracted to other transgender people, They seem to have the equivalent of what non-binary would be and people are like well I can’t be perfect and of course it’s not I mean I’m would still be shunned if I wanted to be a school teacher in school they still teach it as a mental illness which is surprising because Tylan is so advanced yet Vietnam is more advanced when it comes to this because the health minister part of the communist party is actually come out and said it’s not a mental illness so anybody that claims it is publicly is publicly going against the communist party in the party Vietnam. so technically they’re committing sedition and my question is how far will the Vietnamese government allow sedition to go like today it may just be that they’re disagreeing with the health minister but once you allow anyone to break your rules or laws feed you give them an inch they’ll take a mile or I should say you give them a centimeters they’ll take a kilometer so I find it very dangerous that the government is allowing this type of seditious action to take place publicly where people post publicly online that the health minister is out of their mind is crazy or is stupid doesn’t know what they’re talking about like this is the health minister minister of our communist party the one shoe party of the one united Vietnam I don’t understand how this is allowed. As an American I have been raised differently where I can do certain things say certain things about my own government but as it gets in Vietnam I respect their laws I respect the rules so I think I have a right to get upset when other people violate these laws these laws were meant for a reason not every country can work the way the United States does. Not all governments work the same summer GM’s need to protect themselves and have to restrict and limit what people can and can’t say there’s some countries where you have no idea what the truth is because they’ve all the sudden a lot of freedom of press without any regulation where they just print anything you could make something up the United States has trusted us news networks I am no way shape or form trust most of the news anymore because it’s basically all owned by three corporations so all the news I get said is coming from capitalist they just want me to consume NPR is the closest thing that comes to the news that I will listen to and I also will listen to democracy now of course people are going to say it’s slanted but if you are starting at the truth and the other side is complete BS of course one side is going to be slanted but it’s slanted towards the truth that’s what gets me nowadays is we have a scientist that come and speak  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Fact and then places like Fox News will get people to oppose it did a complete whack jobs like when you go up against the truth like you’re a crazy person and was ironic is fox is banned in so many countries because technically it’s not a new source it’s not a new station many of their programs are for entertainment purposes only they were taken to court and that was their defense they said we are not a news net work we are for entertainment like Hannity I don’t O’Reilly factor all those type of shows aren’t news shows their entertainment shows so they can say make up whatever they want because they’re not holding the same standard as the news wow I really got off on a tangent today. how do you like my school girl outfit do I look cute in it I think I do I think I look pretty beautiful I had a great day at the park yesterday I’ll try and catch up in the morning about chinatown where I went to today </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Happy Diwali everyone. I hope everyone’s having a great holiday that celebrates Diwali. Yesterday I went to Wat Pho. I have never had any issues using the bathroom ceiling Thailand is actually always pointed me to the women’s bathroom but there was the first time they tried kicking me out and I had a show on the law of equal rights here in Thailand I asked him where the other bathroom was in Thailand if there’s not a third bathroom you have to allow people to use the gender they identify as they were going to seriously send me in with all the men and I was trying to look as close as possible and his family as possible I look far more feminine than many of the East Germans during the Olympics in Moscow so like that it was just Terrifying and I basically had to tell them that I had an operation and then they let me use the clutch bathroom I mean there’s all these separate stalls what do people think is going to happen like I’m going to use the bathroom I’m gonna pee and I’m gonna leave so that was highly disappointing I have never had that problem in all of Thailand i’ve always had the helpers in charge of the bathrooms put me in the woman’s bathroom even have tried to use the handicap bathroom they told me no no women’s bathroom and for this lady to try and put me over with the men first violated Thai law but then completely win against The laws of Thailand like correct me if I’m wrong maybe I’m reading the wrong PDF but the one in English states very clearly fit about gender equality and the gender you identifiers the bathroom that you use so unless this is untrue I don’t know why they would print it in English because it very plainly stated in English problem was she couldn’t read English and so like the translation wasn’t gonna work cause I could put anything in the translation I went live and got stuck with a bunch of morons from the United States that don’t respect veterans that are LGBTQ and they must have been the stupidest bunch of ever met I told him I didn’t transition till eight years after I retired and they told me I disgraced the uniform and like how I retired I am basically the same as a civilian I’m a retired military member and the retired military reserves through. People need to realize they’re being no different than the racist fathers her grandfathers were about people of color in the military they’re being homophobic they’re being trans phobic who am I hurting I’m not serving in the military I gotta ask stupid questions like did I wear a special uniform why would I wear a special uniform when I I didn’t transition until last year in VA hospital and like you need help you need to go to the VA. I went to the VA they’re the ones that help me understand my gender identity they’re the ones that helped me with a lot of the ones that I helped undo so much of my problems.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> People in the USA don’t get how crazy most of the world thinks the US says they are full of religious zealots that I got so much do you need to ask the Lord Jesus for forgiveness￼￼. Please read “Matthew 19:12” eunuchs are the biblical term for transgender. The gospels teaches absolutely nothing negative against transgender there to rejoice and be loved by God the same as any others and says there are those that are born that way those that used to be that way and those that are forced to be that way and all three are to be excepted the same in the glory of God so for all your Bible thumping religious freaks out there that want to use the Bible against me read your own Bible read what Matthew  19- 12 actually says￼ abut Dũng trans gender . I can’t use the exact quote because every single one of the Bibles out there has a different translation so depending on which Bible you use it’s changed slightly they all have the basic meaning so read it and you’ll get it there’s nothing Jesus ever said negative against transgender he fully admitted to that they have always existed and that they were loved the same as all of Jesus children and they are living without sin it is not a sin to be a Unick which is the biblical term for transgender. People don’t get that they see the United States as a religious zealot freak state of a country. We are violent we all own weapons which I support the second amendment. Our founding fathers put separation of church and state for a reason and no where did they say were Christian nation that’s been made up and under God in the Pledge of Allegiance that was added during the Cold War with the Soviets that was never there most of our history. This whole idea of mixing religion with our politics would make our our founding fathers turn in their grave they were DS.￼ ADS believes yes there is a God but they play absolutely no role in day-to-day life they do not intervene did you not have any input on what goes on in this world they just created it that said they have nothing to do with it anymore and that is what our father our founding fathers believed. so many people had their brains warped and brainwashed by false entertainment shows they call themselves news like Fox News and some of these new ones they’re illegal to play in so many countries because you can’t use the word news for an entertainment show and they’ve been taken to court and their defense was we are not a news organization we are here for entertainment only and for people that actually believe what they hear on that show as news, I don’t know how they graduated kindergarten. bottom line the Christian Bible says nothing negative against transgender I disagree with what it says about homo sexuality but that is in there I can’t argue with the Bible does say that but as far as transgender no no it does not condemn us it does not say we’re going to hell does not say we’re living in sin it is not say we need to beg forgiveness or ask forgiveness or pray for forgiveness all that is. Made up in your head that you heard from some crazy person that happens have platform. The Lakota had 18 different genders my cracks on that I know the air quality nation had over 20 different genders this idea of two genders is a western idea in an American one and that India has three genders it is perfectly normal and natural in most of the world to have more than two genders is binary idea of only two types of gender is such small thinking and this is why people look down on the United States now we have lost the respect we had. We want to hate Putin for what he’s done to Ukraine and I am fully against what he did Ukraine but we did the exact same thing a bunch of countries and we made up excuses and lies to going to Iraq same as Putin did to going to Ukraine he said they were Nazis running the country alive we went to Iraq because there is weapons of mass destruction alive so we’ve done the exact same thing this is why we have no credibility and we have no business telling others what to do Like as a private citizen if I wanna go fight in  Ukraine then </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I returned to the beautiful Wat Pho once again today. It was just as gorgeous if not more today the way the sun glimmered off of the rooftops. They also have a band playing and traditional music and a bunch of Thai women dressed in traditional track tie clothing along with hundreds of monks to come out for the celebration I’m not sure if it’s part of Diwali or what was going on but it was fantastic and absolutely beautiful. The amount of work that went into the architecture and development of all the mosaics for all the different many watts in temples must’ve taken years to have completed all over Thailand and especially in Bangkok you’ll find temples like this all over the place they are magically gorgeous no place else on earth have I seen this concentration of this form of the temple every country has its own distinct type of temple or pagoda but here in Thailand the distinct type that amazing I hope to see more tomorrow. #watpho #watphotemple #bangkokthailand #bangkok #thailand #thailandtravel #ประเทศไทย #การท่องเที่ยว #แปลงเพศ #วัดโพธิ์ #tayhotrish #tsyhoyfish🇹🇭 #yransgender #Kathoey #ทอล์ค  #กะเทย  #ทอล์คกะเทย #🏳️‍⚧️ #lgbtqtravelers #transgengertravel #อเมริกัน #ทหารผ่านศึก #thai #thaifiof #transbian #ผู้หญิง #สตรีเหล็ก #thailandlgbtqfriendly #anjaree #ladyboy (at Wat Pho) https://www.instagram.com/p/CkJ2tc0hgWq/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Despite having an extremely hard day today as it’s the anniversary of the death of my daughter Celia I tried to force myself to go out and do something. I visited the royal palace here in Bangkok which was absolutely beautiful. Everyone loved what I was wearing as I was wearing a beautiful Vietnamese  áo dài , But one woman came running out telling me I was dressed like a prostitute she made fun of Vietnamese outside and said that they were trashy and it’s something that you would wear walking the streets who is highly insulting if you make fun of the king or queen here that’s a crime yeah they had no problem making fun of all of Vietnamese are clothing￼ and she lied to me they told me I couldn’t use my tripod to take pictures I couldn’t use my tripod to take video yet after they confiscated mine everybody inside had a tripod everybody had selfie sticks everybody was videoing they were videoing with staff and staff said nothing and there was not a single sign that said no video and you know photography this was a rule that was just made up for me I feel or a rule that was only enforced against me </p>
<p class="card-body"> . Despite this woman trying to destroy my day worse than it already was. As I don’t know if my hormones have changed or watt I have been crying all day the 19th is your last 48 hours because I’m on the other side of the world even when it turns to the 20th is still the 19th back home.￼ what do you believe in a god or a higher power or whatever you believe in please just say a little prayer say hello to my daughter Celia tell her she’s not forgotten and she’s loved and that people know who she is and her life didn’t matter. She was just such a bright shining soul that she burned out too quickly for this planet for this place called earth and never made it to adulthood. My heart goes out to all that I’ve lost children I am truly sorry. The beauty of the palace did take my mind off slightly but people kept staring at me because I was crying hysterically at one point I had someone come over and ask what was wrong that work there they thought I was having a breakdown and asked if I need medical assistance I was crying so hard I’ve never cried so hard since that happened this was the worst anniversary ever and people try and give me advice and tell me things were meant to be where to be happy like nobody in Vietnam or an Asian culture seems to understand you just need to grieve sometimes you just need to cry and let it out there’s nothing wrong with crying I don’t care if people say I shouldn’t cry to suck it up no I’m sad my body is sad is my body wants to cry then I will let my body cry I will let it release all the pain it needs to do what it needs to do. So in honor of how beautiful my daughter Celia was which is French for having or is sky depending on how you interpret it I want to see a beautiful palace made of gold but it was nothing compared to the beauty of my daughter I hate to say ugly but my daughter was so beautiful that nothing can be called beautiful after knowing this sweet child of mine this sweet little girl who did nothing but love was born three days before I was born and now I hate my birthday I can never have kids myself and I can only imagine how much it would hurt to carry this child around that I didn’t get to do I’m so jealous that I didn’t get that extra time of ever having a child inside of me. I love everybody I have a great day love you and then Commons tell me what you think I should do tomorrow and if you know of where I can buy a replacement tripod for my phone one that has a light preferably and the connectors to hold your phone please, and let me know thank you everyone you are all beautiful wonderful people I love you￼ take a look at some of these beautiful pictures. I love all the beauty in the world because it reminds me of just how beautiful cilia truly is not what it is there’s a moment in time a brief moment of six months where she will always exist and always be alive and always be there she is alive and well in that time unfortunately I’m a three-dimensional creature not fourth dimensional and I moved forward in the timeline while she is forever in that timeline and I just hope I pass me the gun I am so depressed sad people I don’t know how to explain it I’m so disappointed in people that said they were my friends and I have not heard a single person check up on me my wife is the only person that seems to care </p>
<p class="card-body"> . AA is a complete joke an absolute joke when you reach out for help beg for help right for someone to talk to you for anyone to talk to you and just because you’re trans or I don’t know I’m I just an ass and just everyone hates me I got no responses nothing zero that a single person wrote me back not a single person checked up not a single person￼. I’m so sick of going to AA meetings just hearing people lie all they do is lie they do none of the things they say they do well there may be one I don’t want to use names but there is one girl that has actually reached out to me but besides her nobody and yet everyone talks about all the good deeds they do the 12 steps how the programs brought them so much and you can only keep it if you give it away everyone’s hoarding it no one‘s giving it away they’re just holding onto it for themselves they just go to hear themselves speak I feel like I’m the only honest one there that tells the truth about what a struggle it is instead I have to hear about how easy it is for everyone about how great it is for everyone </p>
<p class="card-body"> I honestly feel if it’s so easy for you now it’s not a big deal and you’re not tempted at all you were never an alcoholic you just went through a phase of drinking too much you just had may be some rough patches in your life to be a true alcoholic you struggle every day it’s something that never goes away and I know this from experience from the thousands of alcoholics I have met through the military and through rehab programs anyone that says the cured truly is either lying I was never an alcoholic. The end love you￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I love going to Cherry land, and always cheers me up and makes me feel better. Just beautiful place￼￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> ￼Things have been really rough lately. I don’t know why all of a sudden people of middle-age here in Hanoi have turned so hateful and just been the most worst hosts of any country I’ve ever been in. There’s been people that don’t like me or disagreed with me but most peoples philosophy are if you’re a guest in their home you’re treated with at least basic human dignity. For people that think it’s OK to spit at me￼ it’s just unacceptable I never thought my confidence would be shaken so greatly by the hate I’m experiencing by middle-age people in Hanoi. Do I make fun of them for what most of the development world  thinks is crazy? No of course not! That would be ethnocentrism￼￼!￼ No, it’s there couture nitvminectonjudgr. Only the ignorant and stupid judge other peoples cultures based on the wrong with the word for it like I said ethnocentrism with plenty of people there fools in the United States think it’s OK to do￼. Those that claim the are not transphobic but complain about my cultures makeup NDC dress are very hateful if transgender people and very ignorant gi think we are all the same . I really know it’s out of jealousy. They’re jealous because they look in the mirror and they don’t see anything even one percent close to as beautiful as me. They open the open their pocketbook and don’t even see one percent close to the net worth of my family. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They realize the best education that they can get here in Vietnam went to university degree in Vietnam isn’t going to be recognized in any western country you’re gonna have to completely redo the whole university all over. Trust me I know I’ve had friends that have come from Vietnam to the United States and the university system said yeah this is a worthless piece of paper we know how degrees work in Vietnam and this doesn’t count towards anything.￼ so I get people are jealous and hateful and they try and cover it up with the way I dress or my make up but anyone to take an any basic class on how heat works knows that these are the beginning signs of division amongst people to spread hate. If you say you’re not against transgender people but then the moment they don’t look exactly how you think a transgender person should look￼. I constantly get it compared to transgender Vietnamese women . it’s impossible for a white Caucasian of my height and my build ever look like a Vietnamese transgender woman . many Vietnamese are built exactly the same way as a woman as they don’t have the broad shoulders they don’t have the large chest￼ . I say this in a positive way meaning I’m very jealous of how Vietnamese transgender women’s bodies are built I wish my body was like that but it’s not and it’s never going to be in their face how many beards have you seen and Vietnamese men compared to the way Westerners grow beards. It’s impossible for me to keep up with the shaving I need to do.￼ so on top of transphobia I had to deal with racism it’s very shocking for people to hear that yes there is racism against Caucasians there’s definite Caucasian racism on the flipside there’s also what I call white worship where people assume because European does it it must be right this is totally false humans are humans and we’re all equal. We all make mistakes and we can all do things just as good as anyone else. Our race or ethnic city our creed our religion or sexual orientation or gender identity and I’m sure I’m missing a lot of others have no bearing on what we’re capable of as a human sure natural talent also plays into it but take away the natural talent that somehow we are all on equal playing field. I have been all overctgeceirjdcavdxHabou us one if the most racist and anti  racist cities of tgeceirkd . When will the world just unite and stop looking at all our differences and realize we are exactly the same. I swear sometimes I think it’s going to take an alien invasion for the human race to unite and even if that was the happen I think we’d be wiped out arguing about what to do before we even had a chance to come up with a plan. I guarantee species that are willing to invade us have studied us for a very long time and know how easy it would be to conquer us we love to bicker and fight amongst each other. we love defined our differences rather than rally and unite around our similarities. We may speak a different language but trust me if my heart gets broken it hurts the same with your heart but it’s broken. If I lose a child I am more in the same way you would if you lose a child. when I cry over the death of a loved one you cry just as hard as I do we all have the same emotions. When we’re insulted I get angry you get angry we’re what’s called human we are so alike in every single way did the .00001% that makes it slightly different is not worth as dividing each other over #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #travel # Vietnam #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #trabsfender #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory  #mydigitaldiary #expat #livinginvietnam #transgenderexpat #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #sapa#vietnam #vietnamese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #adventure #adventuretravel #LàoCai #ogbtq #lgbtvietnsm #lgbtq #LGBTQIAPLUS </p>

				<p class="card-body"> There’s something I have to explain to people I get lotta hate email about why am in Vietnam the country where I committed murder again so many people you do realize I was born for years after the war ended and at the time it was a draft for people that came to Vietnam mean they were forced over here. The Vietnamese have no animosity towards Americans they know it wasn’t us the soldiers we were just a tool being used by our government And they except that and I understand that and we’re good friends Vietnam and America become allies we’re no longer enemies. So when I get such ignorant comments as I came to the country in which I committed murder what did I go to the Time Machine was that it was the white lasted five years longer while I was one years old and I came over here in fall. I truly wonder where these people come up with such crazy ideas how can you not know the Vietnam war didn’t license to the 90s I was not a fighting age until 1996. When I was an immature little spoiled brat did you join the Marine Corps because I thought it was cool and they had a cool uniform I’ll be honest I was a dumb kid. But that was haunted me for life after 9/11 came I was forced back into military service when you sign up for the military you have six years after your contract ends if it’s a two-year contract where they can call you back I should say force you back it’s basically a draft for those that I’ve already signed up for the military before. When I join the National Guard I had five children to feed I couldn’t go to jail and let them starve by refusing so I had a combo arms of 11 bravo or a truck driver I chose truck driver I drove trucks and some of the most dangerous roads with my job was it just push through I didn’t stop I didn’t go after people I didn’t try and murder people as people say when someone points an RPG at your convoy and is ready to kill you and your buddies and you’re forced to stop them that’s called self-defense that happens in our country in the United States. Either way you look at it it was self-defense did we belong over there maybe maybe not I thought for a while we belong there I was helping girls go to school that I’ve never gone to school before I was helping girls learn how to read because they weren’t allowed to read under strict Islamic Wahhabi Islam. For 20 years Afghanistan actually had far more rights than they did before and they did now I’m so disappointed the way we just pulled out the way we did and let so many innocent Afghan is that health is just get slaughtered the country fell so quickly he put me into a mental hospital for eight months at a veterans hospital do you have no idea the laws I suffered not work no idea demonic people I lost you have no idea Nevada people are lost after the war ended for veterans the war never ends. sure I got to come home but the war never ended in my head every night ice cream in there every night I wonder where I’m at having brain damage is not a fun thing to have having seen the worst of humankind is not something that you can easily forget so what I do I do to try and forget the most terrible most horrific parts of humanity I have ever seen and I want to dress and make myself happy and look pretty then who is it hurting because I didn’t of heard in participating in America’s imperialistic war machine which I will never have a pardon again so tell me which is worse </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m still feeling extremely sick with a lot of swollen lymph nodes. But at my worst I went a week without showering shaving or dressing as the gender I am. I was a gross disgusting stinky man. With all the time in bed and let me give pause and feel sad for all the parents that have literally murdered their own children. By pulling children out of our school because I am LGBTQ they’ve sent the message that if you’re LGBTQ there’s something wrong with you￼. The Vietnamese government has put out so much information to let people know that they are not only ignorant they are stupid if they believe that this is a mental defect. This is just part of science part of how people are. Every 45 seconds a child attempts to kill themselves every year at 1.8 million children attempt suicide that are LGBTQ.￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Vietnam for LGBTQ children. The only thing worse than losing a child is knowing that it was your fault for your child’s death. For those parents that told their child there’s something wrong with being transgender they might as well have killed their own child themselves this is how serious the matter it is and this has been set a time and time again that you are responsible for the death of your child when you teach them such ignorant lies￼. I ran into one of our old students and they know absolutely no English anymore I could not understand a word they say their accent was so terrible that just because you get a good score on your English here in Vietnam it means nothing in the west you’ll be retested because they do not trust the test here￼. they do not rely on the test and they mix British and American English which makes it impossible for someone to understand what you were saying. We have many dialects if you do not stick to one dialect you will not be understood. In combination with the child learning to be in tolerance against the LGBTQ community and then being unable to pronounce English in any type of way that I could understand their parents are throwing money away because they are learning nothing. Of course the teachers gonna tell them they’re doing well maybe parents didn’t like when we said your child’s not doing well they’re not doing the homework because we were honest you were getting sensors that are lying to you about your child you’re getting teachers that are lying about your child if you ask your child how are they doing and all they can say is I’m fine thank you that’s a joke the whole west makes fun of people that say￼. Absolutely nobody says that in the west that proves you don’t understand English whatsoever people that speak English never say that and there’s all sorts of other examples I could give you where people use words that just aren’t spoken in English am I did my morning exercises with my dad that makes no sense you don’t do morning exercise you exercise with your dad it’s all the small things that￼ I just hurting the children. If you honestly trust a Vietnamese teacher that learn Vietnamese from another Vietnamese over somebody that was an actual English teacher that taught English as a second language in the United States with a masters degree and a wife that also has a masters degree from an English speaking country then there’s just something wrong with you to believe that your child is getting any sort of education. I really highly recommend you just take that money and burn it. Have your child take an actual English test not given by the English teacher in a couple weeks to see if they actually know anything about English if they can write anything that makes sense and don’t have a Vietnamese person correct that have a native English speaker cracked it again what’s the point of being able to speak English to another Vietnamese person to Vietnamese people can understand each other‘s English very well￼ but it’s pointless because they can always just speak Vietnamese. The whole point of learning English it’s all the native speaker learns it. And for the parents that are against the LGBTQ community did you see how bad your economy got hurt 11% down in tourism because people still fear coming to Vietnam from all the problems from Covid The difficulties that people are having with racism homophobia and transphobia. There’s still people out there a lot of people that call it a mental illness and these people are deemed ignorant idiots by people in the west like literally people laugh at people that say this it’s not like it’s like funny ha ha it’s like wow this is the most backwards dumbest person I’ve ever met that thinks this way. How does it make you feel to know the majority of the world those educated thinks that you are highly uneducated. I would feel terrible if I knew that most people thought I was an idiot I would feel terrible if I knew I was responsible for my child attempted suicide what is an actually succeeding in suicide or </p>
<p class="card-body"> causing them to be absolutely miserable in life because the message I sent them.￼ we tried our best to save the souls of the children here in Minh hi we took a great financial loss by offering such low prices compared to what I get paid for having a masters in English as a second language special education and secondary education I am highly educated I was even a doctoral candidate once I just with all my time in the military I never got to finish it and you would rather have people just at a high school or college that know nothing about life try and teach your children English off of a tough of course that they may be took in three months￼. What’s even funnier are the ones that got it off of Groupon and just did an online Tafel it takes a minimum of two years of intense teaching to learn how to teach English as a second language if your teacher does not have the credentials then why are you wasting your money on it like ask your child what they can actually say nobody in the West ask how many family members you have nobody ass what do you do for a living all these things that are being taught are weightless English words that they will never use and some of them are actually highly insulting to ask a person. You do not ask a person what they do for a living you do not ask a person how many family members live in their house￼. There’s so many things I see they teach children to say in English that you would never say to a native English speaker and if they said it when they were older it were lions getting them fired from a job it is considered highly inappropriate to ask these questions. Back to me I was the most manly man you could be in the military it just didn’t feel right I’ve fought in war I’ve served in combat I know what it’s like to have bullets go across your head yet because of how I dress I am judged less somehow my education doesn’t count. But again there was a period where if you were Asian you were considered inferior to Europeans that’s why France colonized so many Asian countries because they didn’t believe the Asians were capable of ruling themselves and basically we have the same mentality going on today where Vietnamese are thinking the same way as the French thought. Which is very sad so basically you agree that your country deserve to be colonized by the French when you say the LGBTQ people have a disorder it’s the exact same type of mentality there’s no difference so you support Vietnam being ruled by a western power because you agree that you’re in capable of ruling yourself if you also feel LGBTQ people are mentally ill despite the science despite your own government telling you you’re wrong which in itself is highly problematic. You are not supposed to go against your own government you’re basically calling your government a liar. So every person that says it’s an illness is calling the Vietnamese government liars and this is a criminal offense and you need to be aware that there’s penalties to come with it so be very careful who you say this to who you post this online when you tell someone that’s LGBTQ that they’re sick and they should Photoshop this and send it to the government don’t be surprise you’re getting a knock at your door from the police ask you why you’re calling the government a liar. Anyways I’m done with that topic now I want to talk about how beautiful I am here’s some pictures of me I’m so happy that the civilized world when I say civilized yeah I am saying parts of Vietnam are backwards and uncivilized they’re also parts of Vietnam they’re very highly civilized same in the United States they’re civilized parts of the United and States and there’s a highly uncivilized parts of the United States it’s like this all over the world I just I pity you if you are one of the backwards uncivilized people. So here are the pictures of me looking absolutely gorgeous stunning and beautiful. I think much of it is just jealousy that I get paid tomorrow. People need someone to wear these clothes in order to sell them and I am a very beautiful woman. I may be a transgender woman but I’ </p>
<p class="card-body"> transgender woman but I’m still a very beautiful transgender woman and when people see me in these clothes people want to buy them and wear them to and I think really bothers people that in one week I can make with the average income for the vietnemese saw her for a whole year that causes anger that causes animosity and I get it you’re jealous that I am beautiful that I get paid for being beautiful and I get to have fun in my job that would anger me too if I didn’t get to have the same type of wonderful job I loved as someone else oh I want to believe that I wouldn’t be jealous and upset but I think a part of me would be. And so yes I do feel terrible￼ for how jealous most of you are that are against me and how you wish you could be in my shoes make the money that I make have the education that I have be free to do the things you want to do instead of being stuck in a dead end life going nowhere￼￼. ￼￼ One last thing parents please reconsider the message you sent to your children have a talk with them tell them you still love them if the LGBTQ don’t be the one responsible for if they kill them selves don’t be the reason why they’re in their life or attempt to in their life even if you survive suicide your life can be destroyed forever. You may be paralyzed you may be stuck in a wheelchair you may be unable to talk there’s all sorts of unforeseen complications that happen when you try and kill yourself especially if you do it through pills you could lose your liver you could lose your kidneys beyond dialysis for the rest of your life they’re not gonna give you a transplant for someone that tried to kill themselves and I highly doubt that your families gonna be able to afford $100,000 liver. So parents please if you’re one of the ignorant parents that pulled your children out purely because of me being LGBTQ have the talk for the rest of the parents I get it you’re too poor to send your children here anymore times are tough and you just don’t have enough money you had to pick between eating rice or letting your kids learn English and for those I truly do feel bad for you I feel bad you’re in such a terrible financial position where The best you can do is eat rice and if you sent your children to the school anymore to learn English you’d starve. I understand that economic time is a hard and not everybody can afford to educate their their children it’s just a fact some people are meant to have manual labor jobs where they live into the 30s and 40s have a heart attack and don’t make it much further like unfortunately that’s just how life is. What’s really sad is those that we gave free scholarships to to teach English has absolutely zero appreciation and I’ve absolutely lost faith in the neighborhood we made it clear to everybody which parents it was that left for the reasons they left just so there’s no doubt in peoples minds that there’s ignorant people and then there’s some people that are just too poor so if you were too poor we didn’t say anything bad we just said you no longer have enough money to choose between eating or educating your child but for those that chose to have us teach for free or discounted and left of course we let people know how greedy and ignorant you are I mean nothing‘s gonna change in this country until peoples dirty little secrets are known to the world and are posted so that everybody knows and if you don’t like it too bad it’s a fact you can’t do anything about facts being posted you can’t lie about someone you can’t slander someone but if it’s the truth you absolutely can post it so if you don’t like it too bad. I do truly feel bad for those people that are too poor to both educate their children or eat food and for those that are sending their children to the Vietnamese teachers that know absolutely no English I have spoken to the local Vietnamese teachers in the area they do not know how to speak English they speak a form of like Singapore an English that no western understands they can’t pronounce the consonants they can’t pronounce the vowels they￼ they just can’t speak English. L </p>
<p class="card-body"> can’t speak English. Take them to a group of foreign Westerners have them talk to them and ask for their honest opinion because Westerners will usually lie and see what they actually know and like I said if they ask him how are you doing and all they can answers I’m fine thank you that’s not an answer anybody uses so you need to learn how to teach them actual English words that people understand so many of the words that are taught are no longer used and nobody is going to understand them￼. And you did a double whammy against them getting a job one you taught them to be intolerant where western countries will fire you on the spot if you’re in tolerant towards the LGBTQ community or people of color or women wear your misogynistic so you’ll lose your job immediately for that and if no one understand your English again whom you’ve lost your job see you’ve wasted all this money on a pointless education enough about that have a great night I hope I can sleep I’m just I feel terrible because statistically there are kids I thought that they’re going to end up dead in the next 10 years from suicide is a proven scientific fact based on the percentages there are children that I really like to teaching they will end up ending their life because of what their parents have done

<p class="card-body"> October 2nd, 2022
 </p>
<p class="card-body"> I wanted to show people just how different I can look. This is one of the warning signs that I’m becoming highly depressed and I’m very likely to relapse. I’ve already slightly relapsed but since Bố Hoà is not really my main issue it’s a concern but it’s not my main concern I’m not getting drunk I’ve only taken enough to go to sleep. One main reason causing loud depression is just how ignorant the parents are here and Minh hi they’ve been pulling their children out not realizing that the centers in Hanoi they’re not teachers they never went to school to learn how to teach and they definitely don’t have their masters in teaching English as a second language here you got a need a speaker who is an actual teacher the actual university professor for about a third of what you would pay so it just proves how ignorant and ignorant is the true word to be using in this case how they want to destroy their children’s lives because first they’re not gonna learn English correctly until they’re gonna learn that being LGBTQ isn’t OK and they’ll probably end up being fired from a western job because you’re not no one‘s gonna keep you at a job if you turn out to be hateful in today’s day and age western companies you are not allowed to discriminateAnyone that struggles with depression knows it’s not something you can just snap out of people keep telling me just cheer up just feel better it’s all in your head why do you feel this way. Or they say things like I told you you were crazy see you are mentally ill I don’t need to hear that either being transgender and having depression doesn’t necessarily cause the other. Of course you can become highly depressed for how society cheats to being transgender being transgender can lead to depression but it’s not because being transgender is a mental illness it’s because it’s very depressing to be dehumanized. It’s very depressing to be treated like a A person less than. I have no idea how minorities made it throughout time this is beyond anything I could’ve imagined. I knew like racism towards minorities was bad I knew home a formal homophobia was bad but I had no idea what it would be like to lose my white male privilege in a blink of an eye just to be happy. I can’t believe how many people want me to choose absolutely misery over being who I truly am who God made me all these religious people that say God doesn’t make mistakes I’m not saying God made a mistake I’m saying God made me exactly the way I should be and if you don’t like how I look then you take it up with our Lord and Savior if you’re so religious. Again probably Christians out there show me where in the New Testament it gives us the power to judge people tell me where it shows us that we’re the judge of who goes to heaven and hell please show me where does god say anything about transgender in a negative way I hear them talk about UNIX which is the biblical term for transgender please show me like if you don’t consider transgender a real thing then technically I’m a male correct and I’m married to a woman correct so I’m not even living in what you would call homosexual son so please show me where in your Bible am I breaking any of your rules we don’t obey Leviticus we don’t obey by Numbers or Deuteronomy. The new testament broke all covenant with our Lord and all the rules that were set forth it was on there were very few laws given to us love your Lord as your only Lord above all else and treat the neighbor as you wish to be treated love that brother sister and cousin very simple rules to go by nowhere does our religion when I say ours I mean mine and fellow Christians is it safe to judge others and tell them who will burn in hell and who won’t that’s not our job OK it’s just not there’s so many religions that a higher power has created who is the no what is the exact shoe one and if there truly is a God I highly meant that God meant for us to fight and kill each other for thousands of years over which name they preferred to go by. i’ve had my wife scrub my face as much as I could this morning to get all the extra skin off but you  </p>
<p class="card-body">  but you can still see the scarring underneath and there’s still a filter that the camera normally uses just because I absolutely will not go on camera with the scarring that I have there’s one video on Instagram that shows me with my scars and I don’t want any other pictures besides that online. So this is what Sergeant Furman looks like Sergeant Furman the bringer of death the killer the gun or the military machine that’s not who I am anymore that’s not the family I want to be a part of I do miss my family in the military I do I truly do but I don’t want to be a part of imperialistic empire I wanna live a peaceful life as a beautiful woman God meant me to be as I said before God makes no mistakes God created me perfect. God knew I could handle things may be a little bit stronger than others and that’s why I was given this extra challenge. I was made extremely handsome smart athletic, I have some of the best genetics. But the catches I’m transgender catches all that white privilege I was given at birth the wasp I was gone so I have to live with knowing how the other side truly does live because I lived as the other side I was never part of the supercenters but let’s see if there was an 8% or‘s I was part of that group for sure definitely and now I’m just less than human to many people so hopefully by the end of the day and hopefully you don’t see this type of image again but I wanted to put it out there to show you that I’m not always that happy go lucky full of energy and full of life person that show myself to be sometimes I have the force that sometimes you have to force happiness to be happy. when you create a thought you stick with the thought you become that thought when you think happiness and love you become happiness and love that’s how you get into a depression spiral the worse you feel about yourself the more you feel bad the more you feel bad the worse you feel bad about yourself. I need to get out of that sub barrel today. thank you to all my supporters I love you into those of you that are laughing at me I pity you because you don’t obviously don’t know how crippling depression can be. Into those of you have to live through depression and you know exactly what I’m talking about I’m so sorry that you were born with depression as well it’s one of those battles. Some of the richest most powerful people had a live to depression and not survived it they could’ve had whatever they wanted the money was no object but people don’t understand when you have depression money means nothing having things means nothing life becomes nothing and you become curious what else is there out there this life hurts too much to keep going. I’m lucky I’m a veteran and I have the resources to reach out to the help I need and I’ve been doing that and I have a very supportive family so please don’t misconstrue this just because I feel extremely upset and depressed is very different for me having a plan to act on it which at the moment I have no plan on acting on this depression it’s just something I have to get through it’s just something I know it’s gonna suck and I got to suck it up and get through it. Peace and love to everybody please don’t laugh at me too hard for this video I’m sorry this is the face of depression this is the face of Sergeant Furman this isn’t Trish this is not ĐTao trish the loving happy girl that I want to be again so badly. I do not want to be the PTS in raged angry bitter veteran that I turned into after Afghanistan and turned extremely better after Afghanistan fell my transition literally saved my life many people don’t use literally correctly when I say literally I use it in the exact definition meaning I mean without transitioning I would not be here fall of Kabul was just too much for me the people I knew and remember I have family from that part of the world I know some of the worst things possible happened to them the Taliban got their names you can’t hide when people are starving. In the United States we let that happen I’m a social Democrat and normally how I support people like Joe Biden  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Biden but I’m really starting to question how can I possibly support him and what he didn’t Afghanistan like yeah I know Trump wanted to get out of there quick and I wouldn’t support him and that either we had no plan ever the whole time we had a six month plan and every six months have changed. We let Cabo fall the same way we just let Saigon fall it was a little bit different but still all that money wasted wasted for 20 years do you know how many schools we could’ve built how many people we could’ve sent to university how many people could’ve had family so I wasted the use of the things that keep me up what kind of nation just throws money away and turns what was a benign bad guy international player promise stay on the same level practically is North Korea they may not have nukes but now they have a heavily Weaponized nation that they never had before he went from sticks and stones in caves to having some of the most advanced military technology and owning Bagram base . so in short thank you to all my wonderful followers I’m sorry for the typos I’ll fix them later my hands are too swollen to type out my hand and I’m having to use the dictation device. So I truly apologize for the grammatical issues and the lack of punctuation. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> September 25, 2022. I honestly forgot all about my problems, I forgot about all the hurt, I forgot about all the death threats and all those that spit on my family and lied about my family. This day made me so happy the pride I saw here and itI filled my heart with joy. Thank you to all my fellow brothers and sisters and cousins that made this day absolutely wonderful in English I don’t just use brothers and sisters because we also have our non-binary friends as well and so for that I use cousin because cousin has no gender assigned. So I just wanted to explain myself why I’m calling you cousin instead of my brother and sister. These were much happier times I met so many wonderful people and I’m sorry I forget your name you had  black lipstick you promise weed hang out please get a hold of me I love to hang out with anyone else’s ever wants to do anything together I’m actually very lonely in Hanoi people look down on me in the neighborhood I am in I’m considered a freak as a transgender woman who is a western trans woman.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Despite I’m highly educated  went to   really good school have a masters in education and teaching English as a second language and I volunteer my time to teach children without money for free English . almost half the students in our school have been pulled out by their ignorant parents or because of tough times are too poor to afford to send their children to school anymore so one of my passions was teaching and helping. It really hurt to find out that all the volunteering and all the time I sacrifice to help people less fortunate learn English went without a care not a single parent seems to have appreciated what I have done these past five years for their kids. English centers are there to make money not to teach you English they play games and they want to keep the kids happy so they want to come back. </p>
<p class="card-body"> I remember a time when if you were Asian or yellow you were considered inferior and couldn’t hold the same job as a white person. The Chinese exclusion act the United States kept Chinese they were born on American soil from becoming American citizens this is how racist my country used to be. We still have a long way to go but we’ve come so very far. I am member there was a time in our history where if you had darker color skin you were 3/5 of a white person. Today still women are in held in lower positions than men and again those in the LGBTQ community are considered less than their counterparts the straight cis gendered people. When are we gonna learn we are all humans we just do things slightly differently because that’s how God made us if we choose to believe in God </p>
<p class="card-body"> If you don’t believe in God and that’s still how the universe has made us. People need to stop saying this is a choice even the Vietnamese government has come out and said it is not a mental illness this is real this is how people were born. And again I cannot complain against Vietnam because I have just as many ignorant people in the United States as there are ignorant people in Vietnam and countries all over the world have ignorance I must say northern Europe has the least ignorance I’ve ever seen and they also speak English far better than most Americans </p>
<p class="card-body"> If it wasn’t for the fact that I hate the cold I definitely would probably be living in Scandinavia there leftists and progressives they’re highly tolerant there my kind of people.  we need to be more like Norway Denmark Finland and Scandinavian countries of the world Sweden when will we ever learn we’re all the same and we all bleed red </p>
<p class="card-body"> We all feel love we all feel sadness we’ve all had our hearts broken we’ve all known extreme sadness we’ve all known extreme happiness if we’re so similar in so many ways why do we try and separate out each other in the smallest most simplest ways who does it matter who I love who does it why does it affect you how I dress what do any of these things have an  impact to your life and those that say I’m destroying the next generation you’re a fool to say that!  they’re smart children they’re a smart next generation they have the Internet they see how the rest of the world is they can see the backwards parts of the country and they can see how great and progressive their country is they know Vietnam has the potential to be one of the greatest nations of the 21st-century it just needs to change some of its ways and fortunately . within 20 years it will have changed. (I apologize for the grammatical errors and lack of punctuation my lupus has made my hands extremely swollen so I must rely on the dictation function and it’s not easy to correct things using the dictation function so I’m sorry if this was difficult to read￼￼￼￼) </p>

				<p class="card-body"> 21/09/2022  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Thank you to all the wonderful beautiful people that were visiting or live in Sapa that came up to me and apologized for the behavior of certain people in their country. They were very upset the other Vietnamese were so ignorant and hateful towards me. They wanted me to know that this does not represent Vietnam in any way. And Vietnam is a loving wonderful excepting country and that there are still a few extremely ignorant backwards people. But I shouldn’t blame them and I should take pity on them. That should take pity on them because in their eyes I’m extremely well educated, I’m extremely beautiful, I come from one of the worlds greatest nations on earth when it comes to freedom industrialization and just having a great positive way of life. By no means am I saying America is perfect , Vietnam , Canada New Zealand Australia Europe all these countries are just as good if not better. But I’m an American and I love my country same is Vietnamese may have problems with their country but they love their country. I felt so beautiful today I was an empress queen of the old times of Vietnam. The lady recognized who I was and she let me use one of the brand new costumes that their company had just bought them and I felt absolutely spectacular in it. It really lifted my spirits to know just how many wonderful Vietnamese support me. How many loving people there are in this country. My faith has once again been restored and what a truly incredible nation Vietnam is . I need to keep in mind that my own country of America there are huge amounts of ignorant stupid idiots. America is close to 50% idiots. most people in this world I’m sorry to say haven’t been well educated don’t know things. In many places they don’t know how to wash their hands after using the bathroom or even brush their teeth how can I expect these types of people to understand the LGBTQ community. It’s unfair of me to expect these things There’s people that can’t do simple math adding 2+2. So I need to remember that this world cannot be judged as much as i judge it and when I speak of some of these really uneducated people I’m not talking about Vietnam I am well traveled and I’ve met people from all over the world. Yes there are certain places in Vietnam the extremely ignorant ignorant see in hatefulness are not the same thing. Just because you don’t have an education doesn’t mean you have to be a hateful person. I have met some of the nicest most beautiful people just don’t have the education that some people were lucky enough to be given. Not everyone had the opportunity and that’s not their fault. They are still lovely wonderful human beings that I love so very much. Unfortunately I leave Sapa  today but I’m excited for the pride workshop and the pride events happening in Hanoi tomorrow I am glad I will be there at The pride activities and festivals tomorrow . It’s one of the great things to look forward to. I hope to see everyone there in Hanoi love you all goodbye. (Sa Pa is a district-level town of Lào Cai Province in the Northwest region of Vietnam. As of 2018, the town had a population of 61,498. The town covers an area of 677 km². The town capital lies at Sa Pa. Wikipedia)(Set in the Muong Hoa Valley, Cat Cat Village is known for its natural beauty, and H'mong culture and traditions. Traditional wood huts, some serving as homestays, overlook mountainside rice field terraces. On Si Bridge, visitors pass stalls selling H'mong handicrafts, homemade corn wine, and naturally dyed clothes on the way to Tien Sa waterfalls. Cultural shows are performed at the Nhà Hàng Dũng Thu center. ― Google)#catcat #càtcàt #catcatvillage #sapa #LàoCai #sapa #vietnam #northvietnam  #HoàngLiênSon #LàoCai #laocai #LàoCai🏳️‍⚧️ #LàoCai🏳️‍🌈 #tavan #tavan🏳️‍⚧️  #tavan🏳️‍🌈 #LàoCai  #instagiid #instabeauty #beautaful #instagood #photography #riceterrace #riceterraces #riceterracevietam #travel #Vietnam #northernvietnam #traveltiktok #vietnemese </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I here, I’m queer, Vietnam is my country and I’m not going any where! If you attack us physically or verbally we number in the millions. Will no longer be turning the other cheek. If you attack us you won’t be met with what’s called self-defense. As a marine myself in a former infantry man I am not the one you want to mess with. The millions and millions behind me are not the ones you want to mess with either. It’s time for you to stop your hate your ignorance and your on education. Open the book read a sentence or two and maybe learn some thing. It may save you from a severe beating someday when you go off and attack the wrong person. I am not promoting violence I am promoting self-defense and self-preservation of the LGBTQ community for too long we’ve been in the shadows for too long we have taken hateful jokes and pointed out and been laughed at been pushed been shoved and even been assaulted those days are over. The days of living in fear in Vietnam for being LGBTQIAPLUS  over the days of hateful bigots living in fear has just begun. If you are a hateful person you should be fearful extremely fearful for your hate we met with the light of love and sometimes the light of love hurts just like God‘s wrath And those when against his will the wrath of the LGBTQ community will be felt upon those that stick to their ignorance and hate for no reason of us I don’t speak for everybody but I do speak for myself and I speak for many like-minded like myself and so I have no problem saying what I’m saying. I have the support of thousands of other LGBTQ I am plus Puype you they will no longer live in fear and there would rather die standing up and live begging on their knees. It’s time people understand and respect that we are humans too and all we ask for is a quality we are not the same we are superior we are not asking for special rights all we asked for is to be treated with the dignity every human being deserves. And if you can’t abide by these simple requests and you persist to hate and persecute us you’ll be met with severe and consequences they will be swift and unforgettable. ￼Stop threatening me. Stop threatening my family. Stop threatening my wife. All these will be seen as direct attacks upon myself which will be met with the most strongest and severest repercussions of self-defense against those act this way towards me telling my wife that I will leave her for another man telling her that she is sick for being with me spitting and make fun of my kids making fun of my mother-in-law all these things are done by sick weak pathetic ignorant uneducated stupid people. And sometimes the only way to educate a dog as well as an uneducated person is unfortunately through a strong beating. And if a beating is what you want how do you been warned to stop the hate a beating is what you will get!!!￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> Yes, pride is. It is alive and well here in Hanoi Vietnam. It kicked off for me with a pride workshop on Friday followed by a pride festival on 22 September of this year 2022. It started with dancing bicycle riding followed by get together in concert at the American club followed by a huge pride parade walk all around Juan Khiem lake. Spectacularly, I was invited to the front of the line with the beautiful drag queens. Afterwords it was a soirée of getting to meet each other as well as a mega concert of many different types of music. There was representation by the United Nation is how did the American club, so America was represented both the British and Irish embassy were there as well.  So pride is alive and well here in northern Vietnam and the capital of Hanoi Vietnam. This absolutely shocked me and blew me away. I’ve been feeling so alone and so isolated since receiving all the death threats after going on TV in Ho Chi Minh City. My faith in my cell human has been rekindled by the love and just pure generosity I was showing at this event. Everyone was so kind, so beautiful, so wonderful and so absolutely spectacular that I have no other words to say. That was an event of  love, kindness and understanding of one another. It’s not like other pride festival around the world to become clicky or either over masculine in or too much of this or too much of that. It was well balanced, perfectly balanced everybody had their voice heard. Everybody was equally represented. I’m so thankful for being told about this event last minute. It really cheered my spirits up. People have just no idea what a low point in my life was before Yes, pride is. It is alive and well here in Hanoi Vietnam. It kicked off for me with a pride workshop on Friday followed by a pride festival on 22 September of this year 2022. It started with dancing bicycle riding followed by get together in concert at the American club followed by a huge pride parade walk all around Juan Khiem lake.

				<p class="card-body"> (Vietnam you have broken my heart with your hate and death threats)  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Before I go off on my little rant I want to talk about how beautiful the sunset wasn’t her Vandalia. It’s an absolute gorgeous country and I just love the Terrace fields. I had an OK day whenever I’m in public for the most part people are great and wonderful. But please remember I do understand Vietnamese I just can’t speak it and the words really hurt when you call me ghost and monster disgusting scary. If some of you have looked in the mirror lately and seen how you look you would terrify the children of my country. Yet you want to try and tear apart someone that makes thousands and thousands of dollars modeling for how beautiful they are. So I get it you’re jealous I’m sorry God made me beautiful and God whacked you with an ugly stick.￼ but Vietnam was created extremely beautiful and that’s the topic I’d like to stick to I would much rather spend most of my time telling people how wonderful and beautiful Vietnam is but at least for the next few days I’m warning people to stay away from the country. The rent follows explains why Vietnam is now listed as far as I’m concerned is a highly dangerous unsafe country to the LGBTQ community. And whatever excuses you use if you say it’s the way I dress or any of that that’s just an excuse to be hateful and that just proves my point of why it’s not safe at the moment.￼ </p>
<p class="card-body"> (I love Vietnam, this is about how a small minority of Vietnames ruin how the  country is viewed. Over I love most of the people and Vietnam is wonderful! )  </p>
<p class="card-body">  I am having a very difficult time without my wife here to help take care of me. I try and hide the fact that I am so severely disabled from my combat injury suffered an Afghanistan. But sometimes they get the best of me. My mine doesn’t work and for example￼ I can never remember where I put my mother by key even though my brain tells me I should put it in the key holder every time I never put it there. Today I found it behind the toilet. Part of my mind feels like there’s demons that mess with me hiding my things. I suffer from brain injury￼ end it makes life very difficult. I’m also having a very hard time with all the hate that I’m receiving from Vietnam. I am a writer by trade, and I have many contracts to write about is Vietnam ready to join the international community as a civilized nation towards the LGBTQ community. Up until last week my answer was yes. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Today I canceled my interview with a news station back in the states because I can no longer in good faith say that Vietnam is a safe country for the LGBTQ community. It doesn’t matter of 99% are supportive which for a higher number than is true in Vietnam it’s closer to 30%. When I have my life threatened my family‘s life threatened my children’s life threatened when I’m spit it when I’m insulted when my family is insulted when I’m constantly sensitive sent emails that are absolutely horrible and disgusting￼. this is no place for the lgbtqia plus community to be spending their billions of dollars. Yes billions with a B is what the travel is worth. Which you generally travel and high-end packages, they like to travel and comfort and luxury. They’re not the backpackers that Vietnam currently has a majority of that maybe spends one or two dollars a day. We’re talking about the type of tourist that spends $500-$1000 a day. as much support as I have received from Vietnam it’s just not ready to be part of the international community. The youth when they mature and they take over the country yes Vietnam will be ready they’re extremely open minded. But there’s still a generation of absolute hate that just disgust me. I’m sorry I am not someone that suffers from a mental disorder, being told I’m possessed by demons just shows how backwards of a culture it is but that some people believe that. And when people want to talk about how I dress that’s called being shallow. Vietnamese love the outsize but ignorant people around the world with laugh absolutely laugh add the Elzhi. Remember I’m talking about the ignorant people of my country and of the west. Lotta civilized educated people that find it absolutely beautiful. Same happens here it’s only the uneducated ignorant low class basically scum that have issues with how I dress. I can’t help that some people just have no taste. And think that you have to conform and dress the way everybody dresses. What the average Vietnamese doesn’t understand is how the average Vietnamese dresses is very odd to me as an American what you see on TV and you see in magazines it’s not the same magazines we got in the United States.￼ what is worn here by many people is very very strange and weird to me it is not something normal or acceptable to be worn in parts of the United States of Europe. In fact it would be looked down upon. But we’re not in America we’re not in Europe so this clock the clothing is perfectly acceptable for the culture here and￼ in the educated and civilized people of the west would not make fun of Vietnamese they came to visit the United States or even residence because we understand you have a different style. Do you like to wear your make up very doll and very plain. You lack eyeshadow you lack of blush you have very small eyelashes these are all traits that we in general find very unattractive. But Vietnamese they find it very attractive. So I’m really tired of people judging my make up Thinking that the rest of the world agrees with him with many of the Vietnamese don’t like my make up or in the minority. I’m not gonna change my style, the style I literally get paid quite a bit of money dress and look the way I like to dress and look because a few ignorant people think that weren’t playing make up is the only way to go and I’m not a cis gender woman. I am a transgendered woman with scars I can’t wear make up the way the average woman wears it.￼ please remember in no way am I insulting Vietnam or the Vietnamese people I love Vietnam and I love the people. I am talking about the low class of the society the undesirables the people that even within Vietnam people are disgusted by. Every country has this America is no better Europe is no better we have trashy people just as Vietnam has trashy people. what really upset me is it not a single person defended my life on TikTok. When you allow evil people to do evil things you are just as evil as they are. Evil need someone to shine light on that evil to cast away.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> So that is what has left a terrible taste in my mouth it’s just how uncaring some people are. And to be told to go back to my country is such an ignorant thing. Vietnam is my country. I am a resident of Vietnam I own a house in Vietnam I have been here for five years, I am on a path to citizenship, I am working on my permanent residency card, I am working on my language Vietnamese skills for all intensive purposes it doesn’t matter where you were born that’s your ethnic city your nationality has more to do with where you reside. Vietnamese to go to America and gain a green card they are than Americans. They are the full protection of the law. They are protected by the constitution. And I hate when people bring politics and say I wouldn’t be excepted by conservatives in my country. You obviously know very little about my country conservatives believe in the Constitution and free-speech more than just liberals I would say liberals are the ones that are trying to put limits on free-speech. </p>
<p class="card-body"> And for those that want to argue with me when I say I don’t like Donald Trump and talk about how terrible Biden is, when did I ever say I supported Biden either I find both of them to be corrupt. I don’t find I have a real choice. I am a Bernie Sanders supporter yes I am a leftist social Democrat. I don’t care if you disagree with it that’s just who I am so I don’t need to hear about the corruption of Biden when I bring up the corruption of Trump. When I tell you Trump will probably end up jail and I’m told Biden might end up in jail maybe he will I don’t care that’s not the point. So all in short I’m having a really hard time living in northern Vietnam. Sapa is great the locals here treat me with respect the ethnic tribes respect me. I speak a lot more Vietnamese the night light on I just can’t pronounce it correctly I can understand very well when I’m being called.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> And just as a reminder anyone does print application for a visa to a western country that made a death threat or committed hate speech online your visas gonna be denied you’ve committed a crime in a western country. One of the reasons for being denied is having committed a crime online hate speech is taken very seriously against protected communities. You cannot threaten in LGBTQ Americans life in public online and expect your visa to be approved to go to the United States Canada New Zealand Australia Europe and a few other countries. I’m sorry but yes I have kept a record of all the people and all the pictures and all the comments that have used hate speech against me. If you read the user agreement of TikTok I am well within my rights to record every single crime that someone has committed. and if someday I do run into you in my country or another European country you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law you have no idea how serious I hate crime and hate speech is in these countries. You are too young of a nation I guess to understand the difference between free-speech and hate speech. and when people bring up what’s acceptable in one country you’re talking about piranha states like Saudi Arabia North Korea Iran some of the former Soviet republics, is that how Vietnam wants to be known as a piranha state. Or do you want to be known as a civilized nation. There’s so much that is done in Vietnam that the world is disgusted by. But I believe it’s your right because it’s your culture. Dog is eating here that is completely unacceptable in the world. You use toothpicks in your mouth at the same place you eat at the dinner table that is completely unacceptable, you blow your nose or pick your nose eat with your mouth open put your elbows on the table all sorts of things that are highly look down upon by the worst. But again it’s your culture so why is Vietnam so disrespectful to my culture. I don’t disrespect your culture I promote it in the best ways I can cause is much as there’s things in the culture that disgust me there’s far more beautiful wonderful things that I love about the culture. </p>
<p class="card-body"> So I to those that live in glass houses should not throw stones. Vietnam is a glass house throwing stones at me. That means stones could be thrown back so easily and your house would be broken. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Because as strange and odd as you find the things I do the majority of the civilized world feel the exact same way about Vietnam. And if we want to talk about how people dress many women wear all black in the long boots that is how prostitutes dressed in the west many Westerners get confused because we see how the women dress and we assume they’re prostitute 21st come to Vietnam But that’s not at all the case that’s just how they like to dress. So why is it that I respect your culture and how women like to dress but you don’t respect how I like to dress. If you’ve ever watched any of our movies pretty woman for example that has basically exactly how many of the women hair dress. Or they wear the one piece suits where it’s the same color top with pants that looks completely ridiculous in many cultures yeah it looks fine in Vietnam. I’m so tired of people saying how ridiculous I look not understanding how absolutely ridiculous Vietnam is seen through the eyes of the rest of the world. But they don’t understand the beauty in your country I love Vietnam I love so much about it. But the hatefulness that is something that you really need to learn to change. Businesses left China because of how disrespectful they were and how they didn’t respect human rights or the LGBTQ community. Companies are not going to invest in Vietnam if the same hate exists here there’s so many other developing countries that don’t have this hate. But then I see in 10 years most of this being solved on its own the younger generation is so open minded so well educated so well cultured. I truly don’t know what happened to this lost generation of Vietnam that is just Beyond ignorant. I have been all over the world and this certain age group here in Vietnam is by far one of the most ignorant age groups that exist in the entire world I’ve been to places where they may not know a lot may not be well educated but they don’t hate the way Vietnamese of a certain age here I hate. And I would never be ranting like this if it wasn’t for getting over 27 death threats. Yes that threats when you threaten my life you better hope I never see you in public. Remember in your own law you now threatened my life I have the right to retaliate against you I am 180 cm tall 90 kg of muscle you don’t stand a chance against me. So you really better think twice before you threaten my life and your IP is completely open listing your name and exactly where you live. That is extremely stupid on your end to tell me where you live after you’ve threatened my life. So people all I ask is when you see that he committed if you want Vietnam to be seen in a positive light do you need to stop these people when they write these things otherwise you’re just as guilty just as bad as they are. Please prove to the world the ignorant that happens here in this country is just a minority a small percentage of the country it’s not the majority of the country this country is a beautiful place. I’ve rescheduled my interview for two more weeks we have to do a lot of soul-searching and truly decide is Vietnam worth giving a positive review or as of right now does it deserve the highly negative review that I plan on giving certain parts of the country. It’s just completely unacceptable the way people act in this country of a certain age it’s called being shallow it’s called being ignorant. The people that tell my wife I’m going to leave her for a man or try and cause fights between the two of us do you have no job do you have no life like what is wrong with you to have nothing better to do than to cause problems.l?  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had a better day than the past few days. The weather held out it didn’t rain as much today I really enjoy seeing the beauty of Sapa. When I’m sad, when I’m depressed, when I’m upset, even when I feel the lowest of love, I have a smile on my face when I see beauty. In northern Vietnam in the mountains regions of Sapa is full of beauty. Recharge is my soul.￼ A sudden upset as I may be, as confused as I am, seeing the simple life of the wonderful people of Vietnam reminds me of just how lucky I am and what a wonderful life I’ve learned. I have some very difficult times some very hard moments but I’m a very lucky woman. I am married to a wonderful woman, I have many children, I’m all educated and extremely beautiful. I need to remember to be thankful for what I have,  </p>
<p class="card-body"> And also thankful for the negative things I don’t have. Here’s some pictures of my day to show what it’s like in Sapa and Taven. Overall I think I had a good day. Don’t get me wrong I’m very upset and very sad that people are being mean to my wife. You don’t know my wife the way I know her she loves me for who I am. I feel bad that she found out that people that pretended to be her friends for years that she helped we’re only using her and she had to block them because of their ignorance and stupidity. There’s nothing worse than people that think they’re high and mighty and are so great and don’t realize that the rest of the civilized world is laughing at their backwards ignorance. That’s why my wife had to cut off some of her friends because they weren’t friends they were just backwards ignorant stupid people I don’t use the word stupid often but when the word fits I’m using it in the true definition when people are shallow and hateful that’s stupidity. I feel so bad that she had to realize find out that who she thought we’re friends we’re just people trying to get ahead by using her because she’s smart speaks English far better than anyone else that she’s ever worked with. What it comes down to is jealousy, my wife is fluent in English while the rest of the university teachers were she used to work can barely speak English at a kindergarten level in fact my children spoke better English at three years old in many of the university professors she worked with at her old university. It’s sad that some many universities are only out to make money and the students are learning absolutely nothing that will help them. I seen the Tess nobody speaks like that the grammar is all wrong the vocabulary is all wrong and the professors can’t pronounce it the words correctly so students are basically throwing away their money and learning nothing. And then him are jealous that she told her family that she wasn’t going to obey her family and divorced the person she loved. You shouldn’t have to give into hate. If you have a family that’s hateful and tells you to do things out of spite and hate you have no obligation to listen to them that wife is a good woman because she refuses to listen to her family divorce me makes her the good person and the people telling her to divorce me the bad people. So please stop blaming my wife for being a kind hearted wonderfully brave woman going against the backwards and ignorant parts of Vietnamese culture. Much Vietnamese culture is great and wonderful and I love it. but like everywhere in the world there are parts that need to change that are hundreds of years behind the times and aren’t helping the country progress but only holding it back. Being hateful against people for being LGBTQ is one of the backwards things that I speak of. It only hurts the country. Large corporations are not gonna invest in a country that’s hateful. Taurus or not going to return to a country that steamed hateful and anti-LGBTQ. I’m still at odds about the articles I need to write should I leave out the very small minority that straightened my life I don’t want to hurt the tourist economy I only want to highlight the positive but at the same time I want to be honest and explain that there are some very Hateful people in this country that are extremely hateful towards the LGBTQ community. I’m at a loss at what to do on the one hand I want to promote Vietnam but on the other hand I want to warn others that they may encounter hate by a few select people.￼ hopefully it doesn’t go as far as it did with me where people actually made a group that threatened my life again said people like me should be lined up and shot in the back of the head and things like that are just unacceptable in 2022 you can’t say things like that in my country you’d be arrested and go to jail for saying such horrific hate speech. But Vietnam is catching up the new generation understands that hair is unacceptable. It’s sad there’s the lost generation between the young generation and those that fought in the Vietnam war there’s a period where  </p>
<p class="card-body">  generation was just lost and doesn’t understand so much. So many have regarding the revolution to be anti-materialistic to be one with your neighbor to love you another human as you would love yourself these are all sayings of the very great man and I only pray that every day of Vietnam becomes closer and closer to being part of the international community. When I found out about the Zalo group whose mission it was to just delete me and lie about me it really sucked Vietnam back quite a bit it included them in other hateful countries like Uganda Saudi Arabia and other anti-LGBTQ nations that’s not how I want Vietnam to be viewed. I want Vietnam to be viewed as a destination everybody can come visit everybody is welcome to. And I found that northern Vietnam. Here in Sapa and having the ethnic minorities they treat me like they treat everyone else I’m no different they’re so kind. Overall Vietnam is doing a great job every day it’s getting better and better I love you Vietnam I don’t blame you for the small minority of people that are ignorant hateful and stupid. That doesn’t represent the country represents the country is smart advanced wonderful people that are making Vietnam one of the greatest nations on earth. It’s not far-fetched to see one day that it will be an economic powerhouse greater than many other economies of the world Thank you Vietnam all that you do for me. I truly appreciate the love that I receive in this country. And I’m getting over the death threats but my wife she’s still very terrified of all the head that she’s been receiving. I was in the military I know how to ignore the trolls. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Vietnam is so beautiful here’s some pictures of today to show you just what a great wonderful time you can have visiting here. Please take a moment and look at them and then consider visiting Vietnam I promise you’ll love it. Overall Vietnam is much more excepting and loving in many parts of my own country so don’t be scared just because a few people are so terribly mean to me and my family 99.99% are supportive of my family supportive of me and very loving good night everybody bye </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Rain ,rain , rain it’s been nothing but rain every day here in Sapa. And having problems falling sleep and waking up. Seems like I go to bed later and later, and wake up later on later and blink of an eye it was 6 o’clock and then it turned to 9 o’clock in the morning. Sapa  is absolutely gorgeous but I brought the wrong clothes, and  I’ve been freezing.  My warm cloths got left at home. It’s  been so cold   especially in the rain I don’t know what I’m gonna do.  </p>
<p class="card-body">    I’ve been having a real hard time battling depression again. I don’t know how I lost my confidence, maybe  I am just going   through a phase of being upset with myself. I love people so much.   Some   people don’t realise the way things are worded it puts all the blame on me as of  being born how I was born . I  didn’t do to it on purpose to hurt them. Never lied to anyone I was just born like this. It took me a very long time to even admit that I was transgender. That word  used to be so hard to say. And just saying it  again has  made me feel awful. What  happened to my pride that I used to have, I don’t know ? I used to be so proud of myself for who I was , I felt like a butterfly emerged from  a cocoon. I turned from an ugly caterpillar to a beautiful creature of God. And I feel more and  more  like I changed in  to a moth attracted  to   the flame of self destruction.  My sobriety is hanging on by a thread. Mentally I have already  lost   my sobriety. I need to fight harder. I love life, but I can’t control the overwhelming   pain that  l like a string wind is  trying to extinguish the small flame of the candle  known as my life. Each time I hear I’m the reason for others difficulties, being blamed for how I was born cuts down  my self esteem into a thousand pieces. Why don’t  people blame  the ignorant, hateful uneducated foolish  people saying horrible things . In my culture you don’t leave your spouse just because things get hard. You don’t leave someone if they  have have cancer, if in  a car accident, got severely injured in a war. These are things that just make an appearance look different or life harder but it’s still the person you married and you still love them. You would never blame them because other people make fun of them. When I was hurt in Afghanistan some people said I  deserved it for going off to another country to fight I was called baby killer all sorts of terrible things. I was national guard I had no intention of hurting anyone I knew I may have to do it in Defense of my country but I never understood what the mission was in Afghanistan. today I just feel so alone I try and explain myself over and over again. And he won the battles depression it’s so hard to explain to other people what it’s like to go through. And then this country there’s such a stigma and having any sort of difficulties mentally. They use the word mentally ill as if you’re either a normal or a complete crazy person they have no middle ground. I have met many people in Vietnam they would be diagnosed as severely mentally ill that suffer from depression body images issues, Compulsive disorders all sorts of things PTSD yet in this culture just say face they’ll never admit to these shoes. I’m a western or I’m not ashamed of my difficulties. Maybe if I share the struggles I’ve gone through maybe someone else will feel a little less alone and not make that decision to end their life thinking they have no other way out. Suicide is never the answer my logical brain tells me that but the irrational part of my brain tells me differently and it’s a constant battle in fighting these irrational intrusive thoughts with rational thoughts.  Are used to have people I could confide in and tell my secrets to but so many times they’ve been thrown back in my face and I feel horrible I ever share them with people when I tell people my deepest darkest secrets that I’m so ashamed of and I get into a fight with them and they bring it up to make fun of me it hurts in a way I can’t describe so I’ve closed down. I have no friends I have no one to share my true fears the true horrific traumas of my life. Because people just laugh at me or make fun of me anytime of anger or when they’re mad. There’s some things you don’t joke or use against another human being if you are a decent human being. This concept of giving up on someone that you love is just so foreign to me and it’s not even a culture thing. Throughout all the rules so many people are the same and never have I ever heard of giving up so easily and so quickly on someone unless you truly </p>
<p class="card-body"> don’t wanna be with them, you love someone else, you found someone else, or you just don’t love the person. In my case if there’s people that change their opinion of me they’re extremely shallow people because only my our parents is changed I am the same person on the inside only more confident. I wonder if there’s people in my life that are purposely trying to whether me down back to the sad pathetic person I used to be why would do anything anyone told me because I was so scared to be alone. I finally found myself and now I find myself losing who I am again. I don’t wanna lose who I am. I am finally discovered self worth and I want to keep it. I finally discovered what it feels like to love yourself, to feel beautiful, to be proud of who you are. And yet I can feel it slipping through my hands like since between my fingers. The harder I grasp my hands the quicker the sand falls between my fingers. That’s a metaphor for what’s happening to me now, I am more than willing to admit I am not a perfect person, I am full of faults full of deficiencies full of problems and issues. But I can admit that I can say that about myself. It’s the people that go walking around as if they are superior to me. When they’re not do I feel superior to others yes I do. 
 </p>
<p class="card-body">  when it comes to loving everybody and not hating I do feel superior to those that only no hate and discriminate. Anyone that chooses love overhead or light over the darkness in my mind is superior to those who choose darkness and  hate, and support  bigotry,  racism homophobia, and transphobia. So I feel I have the right to feel that I am a better human than those that only know hate .  I understand that perhaps they’re young they’re ignorant and they know no better, but if you’re grown and you know the difference then what’s your excuse for becoming a hateful person. I’m not in my Darkest Hour yet but I can feel the sun going down on my soul. It’s slipping away quickly, very fast. It’s becoming darker and darker in my heart. I need help I want help and those that I thought I could count on I don’t know if I can. I’m surrounded by negativity it feels like. I don’t think people understand how difficult having a brain injury is having and  the PTSD that I have plus  having all the issues I have then  all of a sudden one day I have being transgender thrown upon me. This is something I never expected. And I hate that I’m so embarrassed of who I am now. I’m crying uncontrollably as I write. I had such a strong love for myself before returning to Vietnam, what happened in these past few weeks to make people feel like it was OK to become so hateful towards me and my family. Those that call me or my family names are the true sick people of the world they are the ones that need help. When the rest of the world says one thing and you find yourself in the minority of the whole world, maybe it’s time you check yourself and realise what you believe is possibly wrong. if you believe I’m mentally ill because of how I identify l my gender then maybe you need to learn how to read so that you can read a book or two and learn  how transgender has been around since the beginning of time .  people like me have  always  existed. 
 </p>
<p class="card-body">  To the people trying to break up me and my wife, stop it. Stop it now. Many of you do not understand English natively or fluently ( IELTS score means nothing) I write for native English speakers. From time to time will be a typo. I have a brain injury and the people that said they’d help me edit don’t do the editing for me so don’t go telling my wife small little mistakes when if you read the whole thing in context the one little typo makes no sense. Stop telling my wife that I’m gonna leave her for a man.  Stop telling her the most ignorant horrible things. I’m ashamed my wife believes strangers or ignorant stupid people over her own spouse but that’s how she is Unfortunately I can’t change that no matter what I say I’m not believed but a perfect strangers tells her what her what  I mean by what I write .   Some  people what they want to believe, so  what to do?  I can’t change their mind to believe what I say so why people feel it’s okay to interfere in our marriage and go sending her links or  sending her things that are written and only sending a very small portion out of context has caused many  problem is in our marriage . My wife does not know what a troll is. She doesn’t understand there’s some people so hateful so jealous and just hate their life so much the only pleasure they got is trying to ruin other peoples days. Every day is a battle for me and when I have to then deal with putting out fires that other people start constantly every day I am hanging on with one hand off a cliff. Just trying to hold on one more day without letting go and following to the bottom falling to my end. So if you’re one of these ignorant idiots stop it. If you do not speak English natively or fluently  , you  do not understand what a typo is don’t go trying to interpret this to my wife. I think my wife understands me better than a perfect stranger (or some of her hateful ignorant friends)  trying to see what I write. And if she doesn’t then we have huge problems. Many people think they speak English quite well and when I speak with them I have no idea what they’re saying , they’re using English from 100 years ago and just because they scored high on the test means nothing . One can bribe  your way in anything in many countries so don’t be so proud thinking that your English skills are excellent because I hate to tell you they are not where my wife used to teach English at the University my wife is the only person that knew how to speak English beyond the kindergarten level. The professors there could barely speak English in a kindergarten level. I couldn’t believe how terrible the English was of most of the university teachers when my wife used to teach. So if these are the type of people reading what I write and then trying to explain to my wife what I am saying please remember who is the native English speaker and who can barely speak English. Also keep in mind when this  is this translated into Vietnamese it doesn’t know how to translate my dialect of English. Is that it translated into the most crazy things that make no sense. So please if it’s not your marriage don’t get involved leave our marriage alone and if you are the type it keeps calling us names calling my wife names if you’re Christian you obviously must not believe in hell or purgatory for the punishment that’s coming to you. And if you’re Buddhist you have a huge sack of negative karma that’s gonna follow you to the next life for the problems you’re causing in this life. I love my wife. Stop telling her to leave me. We have gotten through far worse issues. Issues that would have  ended 82%of marriages  in my country, we survived and became stronger. I pray the same happens again. My wife is my world  and my only friend . With our her I have nothing. Please don’t put more pressure on her. Love and peace to all 😍🥰😘

				<p class="card-body"> Hello everyone! I hope you had a great weekend. I had no idea it was the mid autumn festIval and missed most of the celebration. No one said anything to me. In Sapa they called it the lunar celebration so I thought it was just for Sapa at night so  I went to Ta Vân. I have brain damage from a TBI from combat. I need to reminded of  the day, or even what  year it is. My memory is that bad. I was sad because  I really like the   mid-autumn  festival here in Vietnam. The Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, which was  on September 10 this year. It’s “Tết Trung Thu” in Vietnam but similar days are celebrated in many other rice harvesting  nations . It’s also called the lunar celebration. In the USA we have the harvest moon  celebration in agriculture areas. When we harvest all though the night from light of the full moon, giving it the name of  a harvest moon. The festival was very familiar to me as an American from an agricultural  area we had almost the  same festival with different stories . We have a harvest dance. Celebration, carnivals and more. Both Canadian and American thanksgiving is a form  of a harvest Celebration. It’s the  end of Summer. Autumn starts  21/09 in the USA. A poor harvest meant certain starvation  in the freezing cold months of winter in North America. I’m battling severe depression today. Having seen my country attacked with my own eyes is so different from  seeing it on TV. The smells, the vibration, the absolute panic of this day 21 years ago that for ever changed my life. I was so depressed today I did not even get ready. I did not transform my self into the  beautiful woman I am for me or the first time in  over a year!  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had to leave Hanoi for a little bit. I took the night bus to e. I ended up being put on the wrong bus that was an absolute nightmare. I am far too large to fit on those tiny sleeper buses. I usually take the large sleeper bus is that have your own bed. I am really starting to have second thoughts about Vietnam. I love the younger generation and I love the generation that fought in the war. For the people my age seem to be extremely ignorant and stupid i’ve been receiving death threats my wife’s been called mentally ill they tell us our marriage isn’t real all sorts of crazy things that no normal civilized people say. I just don’t know what happened to the generation of people between 35 and 55. The younger ones and the older ones are very open minded,  excepting and educated. Then there’s a small minority that’s just so horribly ignorant it’s making the whole country look absolutely terrible . i’m being interviewed on a station in the United States about what it’s like being transgender in Vietnam. originally I had a lot of positive things to say. I really don’t know what I’m going to say now. The main thing they want to know is is it safe to travel as a tourist if you’re LGBTQ. I would’ve said yes before, I am really wondering if I should say that. now that people actually threaten my life and tried to ruin my wife’s career I don’t know if Vietnam is the safe country I thought it was. I’m really really scared and I had to leave Hanoi because of the threats. It just became too dangerous for me to stay in Hanoi. I feel bad for my wife and kids I couldn’t stay around they wanted me to leave as well because there was no way that any of us felt safe with the type of hate, ignorance, stupidity and I’m sorry to say this idiots are saying. They’re just spreading pure lies. I understand that after the war Vietnam couldn’t invest in education so there’s a lost generation that just has no education. Don’t get me wrong the majority of Vietnam is well educated well cultured very good people. Vietnam hast to get rid of this idea that just because you’re older,  you deserve Timo be shown respect  when they were saying saying something extremely ignorant and extremely hateful . The developed world knows you have the right to correct people if they’re older than you and  are  speaking hate. Hate is never acceptable. Hate needs to be educated. hopefully things cool off over the next few weeks. It just horrifies me how sick people are and how jealous they are of me. I’m sorry I’m extremely smart, extremely beautiful, extremely well educated, I’m sorry I get paid well for what I do. That’s no excuse to spread lies online about me to try and cause me to lose work. In the next life maybe my life will be more difficult why are you gaining negative karma in this life by being so horrible towards me and my family. people claim to be Catholic and Buddhist in name only . Very rarely do I see them actually practice true Catholicism and true Buddhism. You would never make fun of me call me mentally ill or sick for how God the creator whatever you believe in made me. When you make fun of me and call me sick you are directly disrespecting Jesus or Buddha depending on your belief. So please remember when you disrespect me and call me or my wife names you are insulting both Jesus and Buddha and calling them the same names you call me. We are not judged based on how we treat the best of society, we are Judged on how we treat those that are marginalized. And then they are going to be charged l very harshly for how terrible they have treated my family and I </p>

				<p class="card-body"> TikTok’s supports hate and sis  nothing about death threats posted! I’m so disgusted by how many ignorant hateful stupid people are jealous of me so they lie about me. Most of Vietnam is not Backwards and  ignorant  but so much of the developed world feels it is backwards and ignorant because of how terrible this small minority act. It’s getting harder and harder to defend Vietnam every day to people in the west that see the hell the ignorant people are putting my family and I  through. I look forward to when the new generation is running the country and stops allowing hate to be accepted. The constants harassment is truly getting bad. I will be interviewed back in the USA in two weeks about being transgender and if Vietnam is safe for the LGBTQ community to visit. I don’t know what I’m going to say after how terrible sone people have become. Death threats is too much! My positive feelings are fading fast .  Do people really have nothing better to do than report videos and lie about then. Why is lying acceptable in Vietnamese culture? I don’t understand it. I see woman wearing tall black boots that represents prostitution but I don’t complain because I know the wear it that way. But I get death threats and called a prostitute for being transgender? WTF???? Are some people so dumb they don’t know what nudity is? Tge same people tgst call me a man complain I have breasts? But fat men with fat larger breasts can be shirtless???? #tiktoksupportshate #tiktokistransphobic #wesupporttayhotrish #stopdiscriminatingagainsttayhotrish #stopthehateagainsttayhotrish #stopsuspendingtayhotrish #stopharrasingtayhotrish #stopbanningtayhotrish #stopyourignorancetiktok #stopsupportinghatetiktok #tiktokishateful  (at Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/CiN3jSUB5wt/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Proof beyond a shadow of any doubt that I am being discriminated against by a transphobic employe that hates the LGBTQ community , TikTok seems to listen to feed back. Please write them to show your disgust at their hate.  You don’t have to like me or agree with who I am. Evil regimes also start off attacking the weakest minority. Then when they come for you there will be no one left to help as you stood silent allowing Beijing China 🇨🇳 to dictate the works what can and can’t be seen. Do you see any nudity or sex in the video? They have even banned me for saying “I love you” back to my fans that say “I love you” to me??? </p>

				<p class="card-body"> What a great national day we had yesterday. My wife and I celebrated in the morning and then the afternoon we got ready together and I went to my AA meeting afterwords I walked around Juan Khiem lake and that all sorts of interesting people I met a nice couple from the Philippines I met . People from Europe and from South Africa from Brazil,  Argentina,  Australia , Everywhere. It’s so nice to meet new people each day and it amazes me how kind and caring people are at Hoàn Kiêm lake. Very Rarely do I receive hate. When I do unfortunately it’s from a few people selling things that have the nerve to laugh and make fun of me not realizing my wife is my wife. So she tells me that what they basically say in Vietnamese and they made fun of me and laughed at me and said how ugly I am and then afterwards in English told me I should buy stuff from them.  These ladies definitely had no beauty whatsoever. First so then to make fun of me they were throwing rocks at glass houses while they lived in glass houses themselves. Thank you to all my fans and supporters that came up to me and gave me encouragement is everyone knows I have been having a very rough week with my sobriety . I’ve been trying the best I can I’ve been doing OK . I lost a friend that I was just getting to know at one of my meetings and he leaves so but good luck to him. I’m so happy that me and my wife are getting along so well. I think it’s finally getting through her head that I’m never going to be attracted to males it’s not something that I worry about. My orientation has never been something of confusion. It’s my gender. I’m still so confused why it’s such a big deal. What does it matter If you want a man or woman if you’re non binary, why does it matter what you like to do or how you dress. I understand in the olden days we had to have traditional ways of doing things in order to survive we had to have these strict rules in society. It’s 2022 if you ever read the forever war by  author Joe Haldeman you’d be amazed at how well he predicted exactly what would happen with gender. He went a little overboard in too far with it but the main point was everything comes full circle eventually. Gender is a construct. I’m happy I was able to get that point across on Vietnamese television to explain that it’s an imaginary concept as I’ve said time and time again I’m not saying sexism imaginary you truly are born with different organs. But as far as gender that is a construct of the imagination. So it’s now Saturday another day of the holiday I’m a little bit worried that my military pay may not arrive in time the banks here are sticklers and I think they put the wrong number for my zip code. So I have to wait until hopefully Monday when banks open to see if I get paid or my money is last which will really be quite upsetting. How where should I go travel to next I’ve been discipline many times but I wanna go someplace cool I would go today lot but it’s just too far away if I had a motorcycle I would do the loop everybody talks about. Anyone knows a good place to rent a good motorcycle I’m with good suspension and I can put luggage on love to know about that I don’t want to pay western tourist prices I could pretty much just buy a motorcycle and resell it at taking a 30% loss so I’d still be doing better than renting a bike from month paying some of the fees they charge. When I go to SaLa  I pay no more than 50,000 Dong for a motorbike per day I’m the most I’ve ever paid is 150,000 these are for scooters for a good motorcycle I understand I would pay more but I would expect a pretty good rate for the month. Also looking for used SIM cards anyone has any SIM cards that they brought that they no longer need from whatever country besides Vietnam let me know I’d be interested in either buying them or if you wanna just throw it away giving them to me thank you everyone have a great weekend have a great holiday weekend Việt nam vô địch  happy national day happy Independence Day. </p>

<p class="card-body"> “All people are created equal; they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. </p>
<p class="card-body"> This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free. </p>
<p class="card-body"> The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of the French Revolution made in 1791 also states: All men are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Those are undeniable truths. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French colonists, in the name of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. </p>
<p class="card-body"> In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have enforced inhuman laws; they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North, Center, and South of Vietnam in order to destroy our national unity and prevent our people from being united. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slaughtered our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in bloodbaths. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have fettered public opinion; they have practiced obscurantism against our people. </p>
<p class="card-body"> To weaken our race they have forced us to use opium and alcohol. </p>
<p class="card-body"> In the field of economics, they have fleeced us to the backbone, impoverished our people and devastated our land. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials. They have monopolized the issuing of bank notes and the export trade. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of extreme poverty. </p>
<p class="card-body"> They have hampered the prospering of our national bourgeoisie; they have mercilessly exploited our workers. </p>
<p class="card-body"> In the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese fascists violated Indochina's territory to establish new bases in their fight against the Allies, the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country to them. Thus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese. Their sufferings and miseries increased. The result was that, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, from Quảng Trị Province to northern Vietnam, more than two million of our fellow citizens died from starvation. </p>
<p class="card-body"> On March 9 [1945], the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either fled or surrendered, showing that not only were they incapable of "protecting" us, but that, in the span of five years, they had twice sold our country to the Japanese. </p>
<p class="card-body"> On several occasions before March 9, the Việt Minh League urged the French to ally themselves with it against the Japanese. Instead of agreeing to this proposal, the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities against the Việt Minh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners detained at Yên Bái and Cao Bằng. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Notwithstanding all this, our fellow citizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane attitude. Even after the Japanese Putsch of March 1945, the Việt Minh League helped many Frenchmen to cross the frontier, rescued some of them from Japanese jails, and protected French lives and property. </p>
<p class="card-body"> From the autumn of 1940, our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese possession. After the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies, our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and to found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. </p>
<p class="card-body"> The truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French. </p>
<p class="card-body"> The French have fled, the Japanese have capitulated, Emperor Bảo Đại has abdicated. Our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland. Our people at the same time have overthrown the monarchic regime that has reigned supreme for dozens of centuries. In its place has been established the present Democratic Republic. </p>
<p class="card-body"> For these reasons, we, the members of the Provisional Government, representing the whole Vietnamese people, declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France; we repeal all the international obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Viet-Nam, and we abolish all the special rights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland. </p>
<p class="card-body"> The whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer the country. </p>
<p class="card-body"> We are convinced that the Allied nations, which at Tehran and San Francisco have acknowledged the principles of self-determination and equality of nations, will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of Vietnam. </p>
<p class="card-body"> A people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eighty years, a people who have fought side by side with the Allies against the fascists during these last years, such a people must be free and independent! </p>
<p class="card-body"> For these reasons, we, the members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that: </p>
<p class="card-body"> Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country—and in fact it is so already. And thus the entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty.” </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I feel I really need to write my own article to set things right. No one has ever interviewed me.  They have gone through my wife. I see my dead name still used, the wrong pronouns as I am constantly referred to as a man. The timeline is wrong. My children are only kids. They should not be published. I am not ashamed or embarrassed of who I am. But some people are so cruel and they know they can’t bully me so they bully my family members. I feel there is still a lot people do not understand about transgender. I am happy that people are being educated , but this is very new to my wife. So writing based of her understanding leaves out important details. #tayhotrish #lgbt #tintức #chuyểngiới #đồngtínhnữ #HàNội #ngoạiquốc #ngườiMỹ #news #LGBT #Portland #vietnam #travel #tayhotrish #vietnamtravel #transgendertravel #transgenderexpat #lgbtqtraveler #lgbttravel #lgbtqtraveler #hanoi #transveteran #transgender #transveteran #combatveteran #cựuchiếnbinh #transabroud #transabroud #tayhotrish #livinginvietnam  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> This is goggle’s attempt of translating the site into English so keep in mind there are some things that just do not translate well , but I wanted my English readers to read how progressive Vietnam is becoming with the LGBTQIAPLUS 🏳️‍🌈 community. I am not trying to change a country that is not my home nation. I only want to change how people feel about my family and my culture. The tourism industry was hit hard by COVID. Vietnam has been a backpacker destination as well as main stream tourists. The LGBTQIA 🏳️‍🌈 community are for the most part  a great community to have as tourists. We are wiling to spend far more of our money in countries that respect us and treat us with the equality we deserve.  Top link is original and the bottom is English.  </p>

				<p class="card-body">     🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸🏳️‍⚧️  </p>
<p class="card-body">      I am a combat veteran that transitioned while in a  Veterans hospital  for 8 months being treated for PTSD,MST,TBI, severe depression , ( I’m sorry for writing mistakes,  I have brain damage from my moderate TBI )and rehab for substance abuse. (I have been having work done for over 10 years to heal my burn scars that  flare  up from time to time so  don’t post  pictures I feel so ugly in, but there is one video of it online.)What is law, and how I was treated are very different. As a transgender female combat veteran  i was  housed with the men  and raped  by a staff member  at Bath NY VHA after being removed from the female locked wing because an older transphobic  woman complained and the transphobic director of the DOM agreed.  (They supposedly interviewed me whil e in full detox. I identified as non-binary with female pronouns. They then actually used my sexual orientation against me because I am married to a female) . I had no LGBTQ support staff as required by law! COVID closed it down! The did zoom meetings and zoom investigations. One day belt get moved me to the female wing just till pass the inspection . No one believed a crazy junky veteran with ptsd and a TBI over administration. The  absolute hell and harassment I received from administration contributed to my “depression” attempts.  I also feel extremely guilty for what my country did to other countries. I’m ashamed of the atrocities. 
        Yes I am a 🏳️‍⚧️USMC and 🏳️‍⚧️11 Bravo and 88 MIKE in the (New York , Vermont, and Oregon ) Army national guard. I’m a proud 🏳️‍🌈 Queer soldier/Marine married with  12 kids,  but 4 are in heaven now.  😔 I was even a bobsled racer in the New York Army national guard  </p>
<p class="card-body">      Hello everyone! I am trying to learn about who I am by connecting with others. My mother was a  leftist feminist that raised me with extreme shame for being a WASP. I have outlived many of my children and was never so sad as when I was  5 years old,  and did not  clean  my  room to her standards ,  as a punishment my dolls where taken away and I was told I would never have children of my own. (I did not understand I could father children at 5 ) to this day it’s one of my saddest days. I lost my 6 month old daughter to a  bad vaccine😭.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> We cremated  our twin  infants that died of  Mercury exposure here in Vietnam just before they would have been born 😭😭😭 they never got the  chance have a life . I was not man or woman enough for my 1st and 2nd wife . My first wife was a bigamist. She was living as married to two people. She had a a husband and a wife 10  years younger. I did not like having 2 wife’s and all the dumb rules.Except  for the sex! That was okay!!! But I was young and in the military in a time of war .   I’ve outgrown that . I don’t need to fantasize about it, I’ve lived it! But i constantly dealt. with jealousy or one would complain if the other wife came harder or one did not cum at all ! Who did I spend more attention on,  who did I talk with more. Far too many rules!  I am happy with just my soulmate downtown Đào! My 1st and second wife where with me at the same time and I had children with both. When they  broke up I was deployed to Afghanistan, where I suffered a TBI and  no one but my new born son visited me with wife 2. Wife I left me for her drill SGT and wife  2 left me for another woman . Both where cheating on me and each other.  I was  was constantly called a pussy for crying when sad. I was a In the USMC 1996-1998 and US Army National Guard   2006-2015. My 3rd wife was Iranian and held me hostage when I tried to divorcee her, but that’s a whiloke  other story!  . She was a refugee and guaranteed  citizenship but had an anchor baby with me the first week we met  .  I don’t blame her, she has terrible PTSD  from the Iran-Iraq war she survived living in the Iranian border city   of Iilam .
              I battle addiction every day. I have one year clean from fentanyl, cocain, heroin, benzos, and  booze. I’ve always been allergic to marijuana and hate it. So I am living sober for the first time since I was 12  years olds  I have never  had sobriety and don’t know what I’m doing but getting through it one day art a time, sometime second by second . Using social media keeps me busy and away from temptation.                                                                                         I always drank my pain away. I have been raped in the military at 17 and by staff at the Bath NY veterans Hospital at 42 while being treated for MST, PTSD, and substance abuse. When I detoxed in the hospital is when I came out publicly as a transgender female combat veteran. Some veterans supported me,  others tried assaulting me. I was back in a war zone. And recovering from a suicide attempt. No one ever wanted to prosecute because I’m transgender and I was victim blamed for how  I look, I was housed with men while identifying as a woman at the Bath NY VHA. Everything was swept under the rug. Shawn and Benita in charge constantly made fun of my queer style of dress. They tried banning fish nets and lace gloves. I was shamed because you could see I had a penis under my cloths. You could see it with other make veterans but I was supposed to hide it?Why where so many “straight”  Male  veterans staring at my crotch??   Yet the   men could wear anything they wanted with their balls hanging out  constantly !  With few exceptions on their dress code. 
 </p>
<p class="card-body">        I was accused if leaving VA grounds and had to be chemically restrained (given tranquilizers)  to be locked in my room for 7 days as punishment . Walking outside is all I had to maintain my sanity.. I went on  a hunger strike and was given more tranquilizers. That knocked me out and no one checked on me between meals  . This gave the janitor the opportunity to  rape me  while medicated . Remember i am  a disabled combat veteran at a Veterans Hospital when this happened. Since I was medicated; unconscious and did not verbally say “no” it was considered consent! INSANE!!after getting the news that they  would not prosecute the federal employee and that  they would be  allowed to quit and keep their benefits. This  sexual predator is still working with people that are easy targets. He had groomed me from the day I got there. Because of my TBI I did not realize he was crossing boundaries. He also sold contraband to other veterans in the hospital with addiction issues. 😭 I was transferred to Coatesville VHA near Philadelphia and correctly housed with the female  veterans and got the help I needed. My Vietnamese (born and still living in Hanoi)  wife of  4 years,  has stuck with me despite all the hate she receives. She wanted to divorce me for almost 8 months. I convinced her to wait and see how my personality had not changed. Since the borders opened and I returned to Vietnam she has become more an more accepting of  me. We still have our ups and downs but what marriage doesn’t. 
 </p>
<p class="card-body">        On the other hand despite all the wealth and privilege I came from I was taught in order  defender democracy those that are well educated from well-to-do families must  also fulfill their duty as a citizen and become a soldier in the United States military. Why I fell for that,  I have no idea no one else in my family did that,  just me. I have a bachelors in history and  I have a bachelors in Canadian studies because Canada gave me a full scholarship I wanted to go  to law school for a little bit but  I end up getting a masters in education because I wanted to be a teacher but 9/11 came along and anybody that has ever served was recalled to military service thus I joined the New York Army National Guard deployed with the Vermont army national guard and recovered from my combat injuries in the Oregon Army National Guard.
 </p>
<p class="card-body">   I am a warrior and  a soldier and a USMC,  I will survive. Follow me to see what my life is  like being a Progressive American transgender woman married to a very conservative northern Vietnamese woman from Hanoi. Our lives could not be more different. I was raised in upper middle class maybe even called wealthy. I had maids,  summer homes , winter homes,  everything I ever wanted.i was a spoiled brat before at 17 the Marine corps ones that out of me. I’m still spoiled though, but appreciate what I have . My wife on the  other hand was raised in a village just Harlekin getting by and eating meat once a month if she was lucky during the hard years  Vietnam was sanctioned . Despite all the benefits I had coming from the wealthy well to do upper middle class some would call a wealthy family,  I did not go anywhere near as far as my wife who came from a rice farming family in a village outside of Hanoi and  put herself through not only university but grad school in Australia in order to teach English as a second language and she opened her own English center and school. Our story may not be  typical, but normal is average,,-average are idiots and I’m no idiot.,. So I don’t want a normal life. I love my life. This was a very brief summery. I have left out so much details, other chapters of my life  , adventures and the bad deployment daysZ brake. I have seen things no human should see. Had my baby girl die in my arms while giving CPR as she went into shock  from a vaccine. I was  forced to take the life of others in state sponsored murder known as war. I am Tay Ho Trish  I am a transbian. I am only 1 year  old as the woman  I was always meant to be!
          In the first year of being a transgender woman I was ashamed of the word transgender I was not proud of who I was.  I had great shame. Now I am so proud to be who I am!  I am a strong intelligent mighty woman , I am woman hear me roar!  No longer do I feel shame in hearing the word transgender . Society had forced that negative image  into my head  making  me feel terrible by associating that word I was called fag queer all sorts of derogatory names but I now know that was just jealousy . I feel  far superior to everyone that  every called me a name and still holds hate in their heart today .I love me . I am beautiful,  I am strong I am gorgeous. I regularly attends AA IN Hanoi . I am
 to start NA back up here In Hanoi. Follow me to see my life either succeed or self implode  in flames . I want more than anything to have better relations with my estranged children as their trans mother. Thanks for helping me stay sober by writing this. The LGBTQIAPLUS community or just known as LGBT is very misunderstood here un Vietnam , but we do enjoy many protections abs freedoms. Sane sex marriage is not recognized yet.

				<p class="card-body"> Today I went to Tran Quoc Pagoda after my AA meeting. the oldest Buddhist temple in Hanoi, is located on a small island near the southeastern shore of Hanoi's West Lake, Vietnam. It is over 1500 old. On the grounds of Tran Quoc is a Bodhi tree taken as cutting of the original tree in Bodh Gaya, India under which the Buddha sat and achieved enlightenment. The gift was made in 1959, marking the visit of the Indian president Rajendra Prasad.  Most of  the meetings are now far far away from Time city all the way in Tây Ho. It takes me an hour easily to get there due to all the traffic when the meetings are. (This is the reason I was living in Tay Honearky in my recovery. I’m not used to meetings being so short. The meetings in Hanoi are only one hour at the maximum. And many times they end meetings only because no one has anything to say. In the United States meetings go for 90 minutes whether people talk or not￼ . It’s to get people comfortable with silence. Some people are court ordered to go to A.A.  in the US so we don’t reward them with short meetings just because they don’t want to share. Sobriety csbt take shortcuts Sơn ratings shoukd br the full hour also! It’s different here in Hanoi but I really do wish that we had a full 60 minutes in a perfect world the full 90 minutes.￼ some people need these meetings more than others. Everyone needs them equally I just mean at the moment I am currently going through such a horrific struggle. I am constantly forced to defend who I am. people refused to look at me as just another human. They would show compassion to someone with cancer to someone that lost a limb in  war which are all negative things. But the most positive thing that’s ever happened to me in my life, I discovered who I truly am. Something I consider a miracle, many people look down on with shame, blame me for people making fun of them for me being transgender. I now understand how countries could be so backwards during the civil rights movement. We like to think that we would’ve stood up for people of color if we where white. But I now see so many people would’ve just looked the other way. I can see people blaming people that married people of another race. As humans we are such hypocrites. We want to believe in an Almighty God that knows everything and we are created in Gods image but when we come across someone that we don’t agree with we look at them as inferior. So please explain to me if God truly doesn’t love all races equally looks down on homosexuals and doesn’t believe in being transgender why would you worship a God that would do these things, why would you worship a God that would make humans that they themselves don’t love. if I’m gonna believe in and love a God then I’m gonna believe that the God is perfect not fallible like humans. Whatever creation that God may make is a creation that they must surely love. So I will never compromise I will never back down I will never show sympathy for someone that looks down on me. I can feel empathy for people that are ignorant or were brought up in highly ignorant societies. And I’m not calling anyone country  ignorant,  in the United States we have ignorance everywhere. So please I hope no one ever misquotes me and think I blame a country which I don’t. I  blame ignorant humans in ignorant societies around the world.￼￼￼ I finally love myself I finally love who I am, I’m finally happy with who I am. People close to me treat me like I should be thankful for still having them in my life when I feel they are the lucky ones to know someone as special as me. Anybody can go with the flow anyone can do what is easy￼ . Those that do what’s difficult, those that go against the current, those are the people one should  truly inspire to be like. Don’t be a sheep , a follower and you don’t need to be a leader either. But march to the beat of your own drum. Don’t pretend you hear someone else’s music and ignore your own beautiful song, be true to yourself￼ or be miserable. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Life has not been easy for me, and at the same time too easy for me. I don’t understand the world. I’m on the autism spectrum and at 15 I was tested for having a learning disability but my IQ was over 130. I don’t say that to brag, those with high IQ and autism have a hard time in society and social ques. Since my traumatic brain Injury I feel my IQ went down. But if  average is 100, and the average American is 98 it’s insulting to tell me to be normal. I’m not!! I’m also RH negative. 1 in 10 people share my genetic makeup. I do not have the Rhesus monkey marker. I’m not better or worse than other people. I’m just different. Throw in being Transgender and I did all right in life. I’ve had a lot of bumps along the way. I’ve outlived  to many of my children . I’ve buried to many friends, and I’ve been responsible for too many deaths. A hard burden to carry. Having to live with knowing you have taken another human life, let a lone multiple human lives is extremely hard on one’s soul. I am not proud of it. You may say it was me or them, maybe it should have been me. After all I have lived through I am not going to be told how I should dress, act or look! I will respect laws I believe are legitimate. I will respect holy and sacred sites. But as a human I deserved a  certain level of respect no matter where I am. I feel differently than most. I’m an empath as my grandfather was and as some of my children are. I absorb emotion. I am extreamy empathetic to others. The insanity of so many peoples philosophy and reasoning boggles my mind. The more people try and control me or tell me what to do, the more I am emboldened. When one knows they are in the right side of history, the right side of their higher power, and fighting for what is right against those that prefer ignorance it is easy to take criticism. My intelligence has always gotten me in trouble. Ask anyone that truly knows me. Same is true of my children. So when I hear hate and ignorance spewed at me, it means nothing. All humans are equal as to the rights they deserve and the respect they deserve. But they can forfeit the right to being respected when they choose hate over love. I will always look down at those that choose hate. I will still feel compassion and pity, but I can not look up to them or see them as an equal. So I also can’t be hurt or upset with one not equal to me. I even still love them as my brothers, sisters cousins in humanity. I am sorry if I sound narcissistic or conceited, I am. But I’m also brutally honest. So after reading this you know how I feel about you. I love you to those that support me or redirect me as a human, and to those that want to insult me, we’ll go for it. It means nothing . And if you want to insult my family you just prove what side of the intelligence bell curve you are on. We truly are opposites. To be clear I don’t look down on those with lower IQ. people with a high IQ can be complete ass holes like me at times. And those with below average IQs can be the sweetest most loving humans in the world. Being willfully ignorant has nothing to do with IQ. So please don’t confuse my words. #mystory #beingme #transgender #autism #autistictransgender #transveteran #combatveteran #lgbtqveteran #transgenderexpat #tayhotrish #hanoi #lgbtvietnam #queer #concieted #narcissist #inrecovery  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I have no idea what I’m doing anymore. I’m fighting a loosing battle. It’s very clear that people see me as a burden and as something they are ashamed of. Now that I have actual self esteem I don’t want to put time and effort into anyone that is not as grateful to be around me as I am grateful to be around them. I keep putting faith in the human race to be let down at every turn at how selfish, shallow and self serving so many are. I can see the writing on the wall. And it doesn’t look good for me. All I want is to be respected the way I respect others. To be appreciated the way I appreciate people . I’ve always been so naive. I wanted to believe everyone is good , they just might seem bad sometimes. I’m absolutely shocked at the  hate some people have. It had been easy for me to ignore the hate because the people with the ignorant backwards thinking are so far beneath me they don’t deserve my anger. What does one do when those they love have ignorant biases. It’s hard when I have never loved or been proud of my self before, and now I am. I feel pride, but it’s not shared by those around me. I’m made fun of for the things I do and feel us important work . I’m looked down on/at. People victim blame. I get blamed for the bad things people say about me. I get told they are not transphobic, as long as I dress how they  want and don’t wear makeup. Basically they are want me to be a man or not be queer . I’m sick of being looked down on for having addiction issues . Alcoholism is wide spread. At least I admitted I had a problem, got help, go to AA and maintain my sobriety. I’m not going to feel bad about having an addiction. Do you make fun of people fighting cancer? So why make fun of me for fighting addiction. I hate being looked down on for mental health issues. I suffer from Anxiety, depression and PTSD. I fought for my country , I’ve tried my best. I’ve been betrayed,  Lied to , abused and yet I kept my faith in people. I feel that slipping away. I’m scared I’m going to bemcome cold and alone. People just disappoint me so much. I am the only person that is me. I can’t live my life for other people. I’m akways trying to fix broken people. But broken people don’t want you to fix yourself, they want to keep you broken out of fear of change. I fear change as well. But change can be exciting! I’m never going to loose the shame I feel about being transgender until I rid myself off all the people trying to keep me feeling shame. The culture I was born into  can’t easily be forgotten. I hate how terrible I was raised to feel about myself. Having self hatred destroys lives. I’m only starting to learn to love my true self and it feels so good. I wish others felt the same positively about me, rather than reinforcing the negative stigma of being queer and transgender is a bad thing 🏳️‍⚧️ 😢 .  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m back into my routine of attending my AA meeting. I drove out to Tay Ho this evening. I feel so out of place. I hear people speak so positive about sobriety and I feel like I’m the only one really struggling. My whole life has been turned upside down . I want to get rid of the shame I feel for being transgender. I hate society did that to me. I should not feel shame. I’m sick of people acting like I have a disease I need sympathy for. Being told how lucky I am to have people in my life with my “condition”. What condition. I want to feel pride, but I keep getting knocked down. I’m proud of who I am. How many people could go against the majority , be ridiculed but at least be honest with who they are. I came out in a Veterans hospital. The ultimate place of toxic male machoism. Toxic male behavior. Even some females. I thought other minorities understood we where both fighting the same fight, but I was excluded by some . They complained about racism while being extremely transphobic towards me. Part of the struggle and turmoil is what keeps me sober. The fire of war and military culture forever changed me. I am not content with a simple boring life. I need that Chaos, that struggle, the fight. If I can’t be a warrior on the battlefield I will pick up the fight for equality in the LGBTQIA PLUS community. I am addicted to a life of uncertainty. I am so confused, so happy and so depressed. I feel such pain. I miss my children and the opportunity taken from me to be with them growing up, then to rub salt in the wound they believe it was my choice. All my exes have played the crazy veteran card keeping me from them at one point or another. Then other times my addiction took over and it was completely my fault. This eats away at me every day. Every day I’m reminded of the children I’ve outlived, my friends I lost on the battlefield or to suicide or addiction back home. I still have the mentality of immortality. That I could never overdose if I relapsed. That I will survive anything. This is so dangerous. I don’t know how to change my ways. At the same time I question if I’m an extreme narcissist or have a healthy love of myself. My mother gave me such low self esteem. I can see I was handsome but I had such a  negative body image . I was made to feel stupid. I now realize I’m far more intelligent than most. Now I absolutely love my body image as a woman. I’m so upset I missed out on the best years of my life, but better late than never, right? We go on TV in HCMC in 10 days. I don’t know what to expect. #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #hanoi #vietnam #vietnananese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #tayhotrish #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We had a great time at Hoàn Kiếm lake tonight. My wife came to the lake after she finished work. I spent the evening meeting all sorts of interesting people from around the world. Thank you for all the wonderful people that showed their support and had their picture taken with me. It really made me feel good that so many people wanted to have their picture with me. I may get hate online, but I rarely get hate out in public. I receive so much support from the people. And I truly appreciate all my fans and supporters. I was happy to meet other people from the LGBTQ community and the transgender community. I plan on working with them for pride month. They will be putting on a workshop in Hanoi that I look forward to participating in. Tiktok still keeps suspending my accounts over stupid things due to transphobic anti LGBTQ employees that tiktok employees and allows to spread hate and discrimination across the platform. Tiktok is so transphobic!. It really annoys me that they are so tranphobic and just hates the LGBTQ community with out repercussions . Just because you see some content from the LGBTQ community doesn’t mean they don’t discriminate and harasses us constantly. I constantly get bullied by employees read right ne emails saying things like I’m portraying woman negatively. They mean being transgender is a mockery of “real woman” . When I posted their email saying that they deleted my account in retaliation. I love ny fans, but hate the hateful corporation that acts like and extension of Beijing. With it’s one tiktok the standards policy. One for cisgender straight white folk, and the double standards for LGBTQIA + and people of color.       I really enjoy walking around the lake on the weekend. Hanoi is such a beautiful city with so much wonderful areas to explore. Walking around the lake is a great place for everybody, family, couples, the young generation, the old generation, everybody has something to do there. I hope everyone is having a great weekend please enjoy your Saturday. i’m still trying to figure out where exactly I fit in the world, but as depressed as I was this morning I’ve teared up a lot after meeting so many wonderful people this evening. Thank you people of Hanoi, thank you so much for making me feel so much better </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Beautiful Nhật Lệ Beach. I spend the morning exploring another one of Quảng Binh’s beautiful beaches. I hope more people come visit here. It was not crowded and hardly anyone was here in the weekend. They have jet skis to rent, cabanas and all the beach front amenities you could ever want. The prices are very reasonable for food and drink. It’s not like the more popular beach cities where everything is extremely overpriced. I had a wonderful time drinking coconut water on the beach, sipping on coffee and just relaxing. Since I was out in the sun I just use a sunblock foundation. Besides that I wore very little makeup. I don’t lije i get compared to Vietnamese. Vietnamese skin and facial features are very neutral. I have a very masculine Caucasian face. My masculine features stand out. Where for many Vietnamese I have a very difficult time knowing one’s sex based on their face alone. I am jealous of Vietnamese that are transgender. They have facial features that can easily go either way. Already having a feminine face makes it much easier to wear light makeup. They also have much smaller builds. I have a great big chest and broad shoulders. I’m 1.8 miters tall. I can not do the same things that work for transgender Vietnamese and Thai. I also do not take hormones or have operations. Not all transgender woman do that. Then I also have to deal with my war injuries on my face. Do </p>
<p class="card-body"> People know what ethnocentric is? Europeans did this for centuries to other cultures. Now I’m experiencing it. My subculture  and style of identifying as queer is constantly being put down, I’m constantly being told that the makeup style in Vietnam is better than the makeup style of my culture. No one style is better or worse. They are just different. I love my style on me. I like Vietnamese style on Vietnamese. I also really like seeing lolita style on everyone. That does not mean everyone needs to like lolita. #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #vietnam #vietnananese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #tayhotrish #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #vietnamtravel #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory #NhậtLệBeach #Quảngbình #quangbihn2022 #QuangBinh </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Look how cute these ducks are! I went to the Duck Stop in Quảng Bình. I got to feed them and hold them. I had 50 ducks I raised from 4 baby ducks. My neighbors always complained and I had to get rid of them. Ironically it was a Vietnamese family from Seattle that came to get them all. I could not sell them so I gave them away. I know they probably, we’ll definitely got eaten, that’s what ducks are for. I had a farm. I ended up not being able to kill any animals I raised. I eat meat, so I’m a hypocrite I know. I just can’t hurt animals. I lost my goat and my three grass fed pigs as well when I lost my farm in a divorce before my current wonderful wife. I got caught in the rain on the way back from the duck place. It messed my makeup and I felt really cold for the first time in a while. Everyday is an adventure. People have been so nice to me. Vietnam truly is a friendly country. At first some people I’m sure are scared of me, but I hope they see I love their country and just want to promote it to other people in the LGBTQ community. I’m not saying it’s perfect, but no place is. But for the planet Earth it is an extremely LGBTQ friendly tourist destination. Maybe it’s very different if you live here, but as a foreigner I generally get treated kindly and with respect. I can’t force another culture to accept me, but being treated respectfully is more than other countries offer. So thank you Vietnam!  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Quảng Bình is full of beauty. I be explored Phong Nha Caves. It was absolutely amazing. I did not understand the way you buy a ticket. I thought everyone had to pay the 550K boat fee. I’m my county paying $30 would be normal,even cheap for a 3 hour boat tour if a National park cave. But I think I rented the boat to my self at that price. I had a wonder full time. 10 years ago I could not walk or talk very well. I was recovering from a traumatic brain injury from fighting in Afghanistan for the US Army. Looking back in lucky to be alive. But now I fight hate and ignorance. Why are some people so anti equality.  Europeans used to think backwards, they thought non white cultures where backwards and inferior. So they needed to be colonized. My hero Hồ Chí Minh rejected this false belief. He knew all humans where created equal. And to treat people the way you want to be treated. It makes me sad when I see people disrespect his beliefs by not following his example. I am a leftist. I believe in the struggle of the working class. As a transgender woman, many of my struggles are aligned with the goals of a socialist society. Yet so many discriminate and attack my wife, family and children because I was born with a different gender than on my birth certificate. Is that an excuse to hate me? Because of how I look and dress? That was the same argument European powers made against indigenous people around the world. They had different beliefs, looked and dressed differently so they must be inferior. I hope this mentality dies out. And one day all humans are judged by their actions, and not what’s between their legs, their pronouns or how they look. What side of history are you on? The side that rationalized raping countries for their own benefit, or  Revolutionaries like the great Hồ Chí Minh that fought not only for his nationalism beliefs but also for equality. Equality goes both ways. If you seek equality with those that have seen you as less than, you must also extend equality to those you deem less than. If you still hold the belief that you are superior to any other human then you your self are the inferior one, undeserving of equality from those that view you as inferior. You have proven you are indeed inferior by your ignorance, intolerance and hate. Only when you can accept all are your equal, do you become equal in return. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had another great day in Quảng Bình province. I was in both Đồng Hới and Bảo Ninh. I watched the sunset at the beach and went to the square to meet some fabs that asked me to go there this evening. I got some great pictures of the area to publish back in the USA. Hopefully someday Quảng Bình will be a popular travel destination for my fellow American tourists. There is so much rich history here, great food, diverse culture and excellent beaches. Vietnam is so big that many times people skip over places like Quảng Bình , or only go to the caves. That needs to change. I really enjoyed how friendly everyone was at the square today. I made some videos explaining the importance of the monument. I truly adore how great Hồ Chí Minh  was .  More Americans need to understand his story, and what he stood for. How he first came to America asking for help with independence and my country made the greatest mistake in our history by ignoring him 😢. He chose to use our Declaration of Independence, and still my country turned its back a nation asking for the same freedom and independence from France that we asked for from England for the same reasons. A true revolutionary ! If anyone can please recommend some more places I should go visit snd tell other travelers about , please leav in the comments. #QuảngBình #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #vietnam #vietnananese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #tayhotrish #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory #ĐồngHới #BảoNinh #lgbtvietnam #vietnamlgbtq </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am in Đồng Hới , QB, Vietnam  🇻🇳. So it was a mixed trip here.  I was hit by a drunk man within the first couple hours of getting here. The man that ran right through a red light didn’t even look at the roundabout and just smashed into me didn’t even help take my motorbike off of me. He just made sure I wasn’t dead  and left. I couldn’t believe how little people tried to help me. Some nice women stopped and made sure I was OK. One motorbike company is extremely anti-LGBTQ and extremely Transphobic and homophobic. They are “ Motorbike Parts - Motorcycle Rental Quang Binh Thuê Xe Máy Quảng Bình, Dong Hoi Motorbike rental”. Do not rent from that terrible anti LGBTQ company. Instead I got my motorbike from Thuê Xe Máy Quảng Bình (Tung Motorbike Rental). They are a great family run business that will rent to the 🏳️‍🌈 community. Sad there are companies that won’t, I highly recommend them. Again in FB pages here in Đồng Hới  some people are flaunting their ignorance and stupidity. Just like the idiots in Ha Nám that bad mouthed me, the ignorant low class of Đồng Hới  is making ignorant comments. They refuse to recognize pI am a woman, at the same time they are homophobic toward me for being married to a woman. Something doesn’t add up, if you don’t recognize me as a woman, how can you turn around and hate me as  a lesbian. Most people here in Đồng Hới  are not idiots like the fools on the QB fan page. Most people here are great, friendly and welcoming. Hateful stupid people exist everywhere in the world . I love Vietnam and feel sorry for how terrible their life must be, to be so jealous of me and my  family. Haters gonna hate! I’m above it. I will not sink to their level. I know I’m better than them so enough said! #tayhotrish #vietnamtravel #vietnam #travel #vietnamvacation #vietnamholiday #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Yesterday I had a wonderful time at the imperial city and the palace. Huế is the ancient capital of Vietnam. I’m leaving Huế in 45 minutes. I am in my air conditioned room and still sweating like crazy. My face is absolutely dripping. The heat index is 107F or 42C. The UV index is 11 !!! I thought it only went up to 10??? So hot and humid. It’s a good thing I’m going to be on a bus. I pray it’s air conditioned.  I froze water bottles to put under my arms to try and cool down. I really over did it yesterday. I’m getting old and can’t handle the heat like I used to. I still think that if I just stay hydrated I can  do whatever I want. I drank so much water and Gatorade but still had a terrible heat headache from heat exhaustion all night. I coujd not sleep until 4 am. I get hit with the worst anxiety before I leave a place. I did not realize how many things I have accumulated in Huế.  I have too much luggage, and this is after I sent a full suitcase back to Hanoi with my wife? Where did it all come from? Here’s a tip. I send my clothes to be washed the day before I leave so I get the back clean and folded in a bag tgst easily fits in my suitcase. Next stop is Đồng Hới! #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #Huế #vietnam #vietnananese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #tayhotrish #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam  #mystory </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Jumy 29th, 2022. I was on  a mission to go to Bạch Mã National Park. It was a 90 minute bike drive each way in 38C (97F) weather. I go there and it was closed!!! They coujd have had signs but they wait until you get there. I was told nothing was open at the visiters center. That was a lie. Other tourists from Germany got to go into the village and see the waterfall. When I asked about those places I was told they where also closed. I hope it was just a miscommunication and not other transphobic reasons I was told to go back to Huế. It was so hot I just had to get out of the heat so I went to big C. It’s a grocery store with kind of like a mini mall. I ate the double double cheeseburger at lotteria and  I’m pretty sure my body is not used to fast food and got me really sick.￼ ￼ At the grocery store is where I meet most of my fans. It seems like thats where most people asked to take my picture.￼ ￼ When I was in the veterans hospital in Bath New York to administrator Sean and Juanita￼ would make me feel bad about what I would wear.￼ They would let men have their balls hang out of their boxer shorts and go outside with no shirt, but me wearing lace gloves which represents the queer community was too much for them. Sean actually tried to ban me from wearing lace gloves. Of course I ignored that because that completely violated so many rules laws civil liberties and was just plain discriminatory. ￼￼ I am so thankful they were open during Covid. Without them I don’t know where I’d be today. But that doesn’t give a government institution like that the right to break so many federal laws. I’m still waiting to hear back from the patient advocate. The way they forced me to be housed with the males when I clearly identified as a female violated federal law. And when I finally got moved to the female wing only to be moved back again to the make wing was completely humiliating. I still have night terrors over that event. They re-traumatize me with the bullshit they put me through. Thank God Coatesville Pennsylvania, that veterans hospital was so much more with the times . They followed federal law, they did not harass me or discriminate against me. They weren’t perfect but they were a far better than what Bath did to me.￼￼￼￼￼ I struggle every day with who I am. In a world , in a culture screaming that there’s only two genders and then I have to somehow conform to one of them, being male, it’s difficult on me. Wish I was a teenager again in 2022 because of 1996 nobody wanted to say anything help me hear about any of the questions I had. I’ve been laughed at throughout my life when I’ve talk to people in positions that should’ve helped me about my gender confusion. When I first talked about the VA in American Lake Washington I was so embarrassed because they thought I was joking they didn’t take me serious. And luckily I still got them to put it in the chart. But that’s a problem I am a great actor I can portray what people imagine a manly man in the army would act like, I can portray extreme masculinity, that’s not me , that’s an act. When I was so terrified to show who I really was of course I showed people what I thought they wanted to see. And it was extremely easy because many of the things checked the boxes for me already I was highly attracted to women I didn’t have a lot of fear. Looking back now that I know how other people are I can say I’m I’m brave and maybe even a little bit crazy. But that doesn’t fall into the category of being male , female or non-minor that’s just a trait all humans have or don’t have. ￼￼￼￼￼  #tayhotrish #transveteran #livingtransabroud </p>

				<p class="card-body"> “The Hill (Bunker)” </p>
<p class="card-body"> Bunker hill or just “the hill” is what it’s known by on Google maps if you want to watch the sunset at this location if you’re in Huế Vietnam. On my way there I discovered where they sell the incense. ￼￼ it looks like a good place to go and have my picture taken wearing my ao dia. A lot of people wear their ao dias. It was strange being in a place were so much death had taken place. They were pillar boxes. Machine gun nests. It was a place of obvious destruction many years ago. How amazing that today it’s now a place to watch the sunset and enjoy life rather than take life. I’m doing better today. I haven’t been on a roller coaster as much I’ve been getting along better with people. I just get so emotional and so wound up when I feel like I’m losing everything. Everyone thinks I have it all together and I know exactly who I am but I don’t. Every day is a confusing day for me. I’m coming to accept that I am never going to truly figure anything out. It’s like surfing a wave I just need to go with it or it could drown. I still feel embarrassed when people use the word transgender woman on me rather than when I use it. I am fine calling myself a transgender woman but I feel sometimes people use it in a negative way to describe me. I am still dealing with decades false indoctrination. I was the sponge just a young soul small child and I was taught that being who I am today was not acceptable back society when I grew up. How does one come to terms with finding out there’s some thing they were taught to hate as a child. I never thought that I was taught to hate much in my childhood but looking back I now realize that being queer was not something that was tolerated at all in my family.￼ I think part of me hates myself. Part of me is disgusted with who or what I am. But the other half of me loves me and is so happy to be my true self. It’s this  dual personality that are at war with each other causing me to have a constant struggle. Constant battled within myself. It’s exhausting , truly exhausting. Everybody wants to label me or put me in a box. Say what I should shouldn’t be. If I don’t do things the way they think I should do it then I’m not truly￼￼￼ a transgender woman. I wish people would understand all it takes for me to be a transgender woman it’s for me to say I am a transgender woman. There are no other qualifications needed to be part of this club. It’s one of those deals where you open your mouth say you are and therefore you are.

				<p class="card-body"> I went to Mausoleum of Emperor Minh Mang (Lăng mộ Hoàng đế Minh Mạng) yesterday. It is absolutely gorgeous. I love all the history in this ancient city of Huề here in Vietnam. I’ve been to the imperial city, most of the tombs , many pagodas, the walking street, the citadel many times. Everywhere it’s just so amazing. ￼￼ To visit the tomb is only 150k ₫ which is about $7.50 US￼. I had purchased the entire package for 600k about $30 roughly but they only give you four days to do all of the attractions.￼ So my ticket to go to this Tomb had expired. It was absolutely beautiful like all the Tombs. I love how they have the statues, it reminds me so much of when my father went to see the terra-cotta exhibit in China. The colors of the palace, tomb and temples are vibrant colors. I love your combinations of red yellow. Growing up in the United States, a country which wiped out its history pre European is a relatively new country. So I never really had the opportunity to experience true ancient culture. The closest came was visiting French Canada and Kodak seeing all walls of Quebec, tge old city, or the fortresses in the maritimes. So Canada also isn’t very old either.￼￼￼￼ Like all great civilizations such as the Egyptian or Aztecs tgst built tombs for their emperors or pharos , here in Vietnam it’s no different.  I know some might not think I can compare it to the pyramids of Egypt but the  history here in Vietnam and the tombs that  go with it just as beautiful to me.  I find it absolutely gorgeous despite the high temperatures and high humidity making it very difficult on me .my make up and I just don’t do well in the heat. I only had one incident where you can  tell that there was a child being raised and a very hateful environment first the father mocks me pointed and laughed then  mean and like his father  the son did as well. I don’t think they were Vietnamese,  I think they were Chinese tourist I didn’t recognize any Vietnamese coming out of them and I know it wasn’t Korean or Japanese they were speaking and I’ve never been disrespected by the Japanese or Korean.￼￼￼ They looked very foolish making such a seen. Pointing at me then screaming and running show just how little culture you have. The same if you saw an injured soldier, someone who lost the hair from chemotherapy from cancer or Somebody that had been severely injured in an automotive accident. Because if you would point and scream at me for being beautiful just I look different than what you’re used to then  how would you act in  one of these other situations￼? Most likely very inappropriately and be be highly embarrassing for you and you wouldn’t even know it.. Like I’ve said many times 99% of people in Vietnam reproach mean respectful wonderful people I’ve ever met. They are so kind so nice and I just want to say thank you all my supporters out there and give me words of encouragement every day , thank you￼￼!  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> (I have attached the video they deleted and banned as proof of their transphobia) </p>
<p class="card-body"> Tik Tok supports hate. TikTok is a platform of hate to spread hate and promote hate. They don’t even try and hide the fact that they are homophobic, transphobic, and racist. The responses I get are beyond hateful. They bully me, they tease me, they constantly harassed me. It’s only for the supporters that I even use the horrific terrible platform of hate. In the latest battle they are now claiming that being transgender is a dangerous act and so they will take down material because they don’t promote people copying me and being themselves, transgender. They should be beyond illegal for discrimination. Why is it that no one does anything about it. This is the one time I agree with Donald Trump. I can’t stand him in any other way but TikTok needs to be regulated. TikTok needs to be dismantled and put in American hands if it’s going to operate in the USA. It can’t be allowed to promote its totalitarian style of censorship on any thing that backwards corrupt government deems undesirable! Allowing it to the totalitarian hateful uncultured Beijing Chinese corporation is beyond insane. We cannot allow a foreign hateful power like Beijing to control an app that can warp the minds of the world. They love using their censorship power in countries that are used to being censored for no other reason than discrimination. I truly hope they regulate that app or they destroy that app. The way it’s allowed to prolifate heat discuss me. And they don’t do what their followers want. I have many supporters yet because Beijing is trans phobic homophobic and racist they get away with doing whatever they want. When I say racist I realize I’m your pen I’m talking about all the people of colors who’s voice is a Binh silence. I’ve seen strong black women speak to real issues and then all of a sudden the accounts are gone. So I I think noticed all the other people they have it much worse than me. i’m speaking in general terms for all the people that TikTok discriminate against and hates. you suck tiktok! #tiktok #tiktoksupportshate #tiktokistransphobic #tiktokishomophobic #tayhotrish #tiktoksucks #TikTokisRACIST #regulatetiktok #tiktokisantilgbtq #tiktokisevil #tiktoksupportshategroups </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Tonight I tried Chè for the first time. They translated it to sweet soup. But in English that doesn’t really make any sense. Generally soup is warm and not a dessert. And also you put it on ice. It’s more like an ice cream pudding is what I would call it. There are  different sweet toppings that you mix with ice and eat it. It’s full of sugar but absolutely delicious. When I looked up what it was it just said sweet soup and I didn’t look closely and so I thought it was like a type of meatball soup so I ended up eating dessert for my dinner. I was having a great night again except the rain came back and I had to stop but as I went to look for food I don’t understand why for a second time I was refuse service. This man would not sell me noodles . And most likely  he’s a gay man that’s angry that I am living my life the way I want to. Scientific studies have shown those that hate me the most are LGBTQ themselves and not only hate themselves but repress those feelings leading towards anger to those that can openly express themselves. So I don’t get angry with those that show anger or hate towards me. I feel pity for them because I know they also are struggling with the fact that they are LGBTQ in a society they don’t feel with allow it. So no I don’t get angry with those people, those people are just repressing their own feelings. Science shown  this to be true  time and time again. I am really enjoying Huế . It’s an ancient magnificent city where is historys secrets open themselves up to me every day. I’ve been here 10 days and every day I  discover something new about this wonderful city.  #hue #Huế #che #chè #vietnamesefood #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory #travel #travelvietnam  </p>

<p class="card-body"> Mausoleum of Emperor Dong Khanh. </p>
<p class="card-body"> I spent another Day exploring Tombs in Huế 🇻🇳. So many different tombs to see, so much history it’s impossible to do it all. There are stone soldiers like the terra-cotta ones didcobrd in China years ago. The temple for the emperor was covered in gold and absolutely amazing. I meditated and prayed at tge top. So many people only get to visit Vietnam for a week two weeks maybe a month￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼. I have lived in Vietnam for five years now and have only seen a small percentage of what the country has to offer. Vietnam is so amazing to spend a lifetime and you would still only see a small part of what exists year. I wore my red  áo dài .  I thought I looked nice in it. So many people complemented me and told me I looked really good in it. But it turns out a few people took issue with me wearing it online. I think the issue they have they don’t like transgender women wearing it.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ I really don’t like people use religion or lie about their culture to spread hate. I don’t hurt anyone I don’t do harm , I’m following my life in a very respectful way to say I’m insulting a temple is just a persons way of spreading hate.  I respect all the rules for going in a  temple.  I take my shoes off and cover my shoulders . I wear respectful clothing I don’t photograph or take pictures. Do you see how many people ignore these rules of respect in the pagoda? I am having  to learn to just deal with it and ignore toxic people . I’ll be thankful for all the wonderful supporters I have that love and respected me.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Far more people respect me and support me than those that hate me 🥰🥰🥰 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> HAPPY BIRTHDAY Kazhal! I miss and love you so much sweetheart heart!  I pray I’m allowed to see you again. I’m so sad I can’t see you. I spent the day just wandering Huế. The street art is so beautiful on the pedestrian streets . Every city is so unique and amazing here . I was Pondering my life and how much I have to be grateful for. I get a lot of hate and jealousy for all the things I have. I’m extremely beautiful, I’m well educated, I’m highly intelligent, I’m well cultured, well traveled, great genetics, and I was born in to the privilege and one of the greatest nations on earth,  the United States of America. This has lead so many people to disguise their transphobia and hates of LGBT community by calling me sick, mental, deranged, all sorts of terrible names. I wish I had more support. I wish those close to me understood that the people telling him these terrible things about me are not their friends they’re just ignorant people whose generation is coming to an end. I love the younger generation of Vietnam there’s open minded unlike many close minded hateful toxic people that are my age here in this country. Don’t get me wrong Vietnam is a wonderful country but it’s also has its first share of people that are just plain toxic jealous haters. My family is so lucky to be able to go to the United States get an education some of the best universities in the world not only for free but get paid to. There’s no other countries diverse as the United States the best food from all over the world the most beautiful country in existence promise diversity. From Alaska to Hawaii it’s all over the heartland there’s no place that compares to my homeland. I’ve done my duty for my country I’ve served my country I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m done sacrificing for people that just don’t appreciate me. I have lost so much over the years I have worked so hard for things then and meant nothing.  #kazhal_F #tayhotrish #huế #hue #travel #vietnamtravel #vietnam #lgbtqlove  #transbian #lgbtqtravelers #transpride #transveteran #loveislove  #fyp #fypシ #đẹp  #xuhuong #vietnamtoiyeu #vietnameselove #adventuretravel #streetart  (at Hue, Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/CgAcnxLBTHZ/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I spent yesterday exploring theMausoleum of Emperor Tu Duc Khiêm Lăng (Lăng mộ Hoàng đế Tự Đức). I visited another amazing heritage site of Huế. It’s an absolutely amazing city. It’s a beautiful complex of landscape Gardens Forest and Ponds with coy fish. It’s beautiful walking all over seeing the different temples. There are so many heritage sites all over the place that I’m gonna be here a week and I don’t think I even have done 1/4 of what there is to offer. The History of Vietnam is so amazing. Growing up I was brainwashed to believe that Vietnam was the enemy of the United States , it was communist it was a bad country. That was in the 1980s and 1990s I really didn’t learn any more . It wasn’t until 2017 all that I thought I knew was shattered and I learned what a great magnificent country Vietnam truly is when I visited for the first time. How many people are still ignorant to the fact of how many  other cultures there are in the world just as special as our own? Just because of cultures difference doesn’t make it less than. As great as United States is we have our faults every country has its fault. There are also things that every country has that they do better than anywhere else in the world. So many great things about Vietnam there’s so much better than what I can have in my country. Don’t get me wrong I’m an American and I love United States there’s so much I love about my country as well. There’s nothing wrong we loving more than your own culture. </p>
<p class="card-body"> I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar and I don’t know if that’s possible affecting me lately. I’ve been having ups and downs, no extreme highs or lows but I shouldn’t be in a constant flux the way I am. I get so distracted so many people being negative about my relationship with my wife. Her family is treating her but her friends are treating her butt and people online or making negative comments.Before  she came out and told people about me I never mentioned anything about my wife publicly. I don’t think she understood what she was getting herself into. So many people that know nothing about our personal life complain in the comments saying how terrible it is what I’m doing to my wife. They don’t know what a great provider a great parents all the sacrifices I’ve made. Because that’s our private life something we just don’t discuss. Why wife has made great sacrifices, but do have I. We are equals. She needs to learn that there’s always going to be people that are going to complain. For example my make up is Lolita it’s awesome it’s perfect it’s beautiful it’s a mix between Japanese and American styles. Many people love it but I constantly get complaints. And now people are trying to talk my wife out of going to the United States. That’s just pure jealousy. My wife and Vietnamese children literally get free University and paid to get their degree. Why are people telling her not to do that. I learned a long time ago that people that do the most complaining are the ones most jealous about what you have. Because you have what they can never have they will constantly try and put you down. So I should be so grateful that I must have so much people that  so many people complain about me and what I have and what I do My daily update, part of my digital diary.  #tayhotrish #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory #vietnam #tayhotrish #mydigitaldiary #expat #livinginvietnam #transgenderexpat #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife #travel #traveling #travelvietnam #Huế #vietnam #vietnananese #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtraveler #transveteran #queer #adventure #adventuretravel #tomb  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> What an incredibly busy day I had today. I was at the imperial city, Palace, Citadel of Hué here in Vietnam. It was such an exciting day. It started off with rain but then it got very hot and sunny and I got sunburn. I walked all over the imperial Palace. It’s absolutely gorgeous. This is just a small sample of the hundreds of pictures that I took that I will be posting throughout the next couple days. Vietnam is an absolute amazing country. It is so LGBTQ friendly. I was able to freely explain to people about myself and my wife and how I’m at transbian and it’s kind of like being a lesbian couple. The parents that whose children I was explaining into understood English and understood what I was saying and had no issue with me talking about it. I really think Vietnam has a bright future for LGBTQ travel. There are so many places in the world that we’re just not welcome, some places were we even risk our lives visiting. Vietnam I have some people they’re rude or laugh or giggle but that’s the very worst of it and they’re the minority. The majority of people are so kind so sweet I’m just curious. When people don’t understand something their natural responses to laugh or giggle and point. I can deal with all that I’ve never been threatened no one‘s tried to attack me. I have never been rejected in a business I’ve never had people who want my business being rude to me. They are great business people they know that if they want repeat customers they need to treat people right and so far I’ve always experienced that everywhere I spend my money here in Vietnam. Of course you’re going to have other tourists that are ignorant set a route but it just reflects poorly on them and shows their lack of education I can’t really fault them too much. Most Vietnamese are very kind to me and not ignorant, but rather just curious. It’s just pure ignorance on their part when they point and laugh it’s also a bit of jealousy I have to remember that in one day I make with the average Vietnamese makes in a month for some of them even a year. So I have to remember to be very humble and grateful for just how lucky I am. Despite all the hardships I’ve had in life I still have a great privilege. #Hue #Huế #Huế🏳️‍⚧️ #Huế🏳️‍🌈 #imperialcity #Huế2022 #hue2022  #tayhotrish  #fyp #fupシ  #lgbtvietnam   #imperialcityHuế #travel #vietnam #vietnamtravel </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I just ate Bún Bố for breakfast. It was so good. Eateries are very different than in the west. The food is good, even if the appearance looks shabby on the outside. I love being able to just travel around Vietnam trying all the different foods they have to offer. In the United States there’s only certain Vietnamese food that become popular with Americans, but it’s such a small section of all the different foods available here in Vietnam. And also the food in the United States is mostly food from southern Vietnam because so many people came to United States from the south after the war ended. But the diversity in food is absolutely amazing. I have been Vietnam for five years and still have only tried maybe 3% of all the different food varieties that they offer here.￼ and depending on what’s in season the food changes the price is fluctuate and it’s one of the few places in the world I feel safe eating the food where I can eat a meal for one or two dollars. As I said how many restaurants and eaters look on the outside seem as if they would be shut down by the health department in the United States. But they’re perfectly safe to eat at. The stories you hear about people getting sick is because we’re not used to the food in other countries (sometimes in some places including the USA and Europe it’s absolutely due to poor hygiene. You risk that anywhere). Every time I travel anywhere in the world I get sick. When I return to the United States and start eating through there I get sick. Once you got get used to the local food where you’re at you don’t have to worry about food poisoning as much. And it’s never really food poisoning is just your gut not knowing how to digest the food properly it doesn’t have the local bacteria needed. Throughout history humans were not able to relocate on the other side of the planet in 12 hours like we can today it was a slow journey over time were you would get used to the different foods. So my advice when traveling is prepared for the first couple of days and have some stomach issues it’s going to happen but then once your body gets used to it you can enjoy all the different foods. Don’t order things that are not commonly eaten in the area you visit. If you try to stick to your home diet you will be disappointed, and probably won’t have it prepared correctly and you will increase your chances of getting sick, (with globalization there are usually restaurants in major cities that cater to western diets, but why travel to eat what you always eat?) I love my life some days and the same time I hate my life sometimes I’m so confused over it I have so much to be grateful for so much to be happy for up at the same time I feel great sadness and depression I’m so confused at my many different emotions. But today today I’m fighting through the depression and forcing a happy smile on me. Had a great breakfast and drinking awesome Vietnamese coffee life is good.￼￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I visited the imperial city and Citadel of Huế today. But before I could do very much it started to rain, it literally poured for hours and hours. I had to drive my motorbike back to the hotel where I was absolutely drenched. I plan on going back tomorrow and I’m going to wear my pretty ao dia. I don’t know how the weathers going to be but I hope it’s not so wet. At least it wasn’t absolutely scorching hot like it has been. #tayhotrish #traveltheworld #vietnamtravel #vietnam  #Huế #lgbt #lgbttravel #transgender #traveladdict #travelling #adventure #lovelife #cutegirl #imperialcityhue #citadelhue #citadelhuế  #hue  (at Hue, Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf2COetB58O/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I arrived in Huế yesterday afternoon. It’s been nonstop stress. Nothing I do is every right or good enough. I feel so unappreciated. My whole life I put others needs ahead of myself . I feel people constantly take advantage of me. I’m always made out to be the bad person. All of my 20s I spent working 80 plus hours a week at a job I hated. It was back breaking work but it gave my family the life style they wanted. Fast forward to now, all the years working and serving in the Army to provide for my family has been forgoton about. After I suffered a combat injury and and TBI I was welcomed state side with custody papers saying I could not see my kids outside of a small county in NY near Canada. I was still on military orders and not allowed to stay in that county (the judge completely broke the law having me served while on deployment orders). So my kids where used as weapons to hurt me, same happened with my Son. I’m just an ATM machine. I made sure my son knew his mom as i raised him the first three years while his mom was cheating on me, gave me a VD and went into rehab. One day my son got into medication that coujd have killed him, and of corse I got blamed despite my meds always being locked up. His mom has never instilled the importance of maintaining a relationship with me. Over COVID. I worked multiple jobs and gave over 20K USD in a year. When I finally got to the USA I still could not see him. No school records, no pictures, no phone calls. I pay double the child support and nothing. Same with my Persian daughter. (I gave her mom my farm I bought with cash in the divorce so she akways had a place to live) Why do people use kids as weapons. The kids will grow up and eventually find out they where lied to their whole life. I have repeatedly tried to have court orders I have enforced. On paper i have joint custody with my son , but no one will enforce it. My Persian daughter is not allowed to even talk to me. I don’t know how I ended up with so many abusive woman. I have been treated like a doormat and an ATM. My kids have been poisoned against me and I feel so sad that I missed so many years because of my kids mothers using them as pawns. In one relationship I am the only one to have deployed. I get VA benifits. My kids told me their mom told then i never got hurt (despite my many awards and medboard from a combat injury in Afghanistan) and they get military benifits from their mom. Yet their dependent ID cards have my name. All my kids have full scholarships for university from me. It hurts to have your own kids hate you because of the lies they where told  so many times they think they are real memoirs. I lost my third born daughter in 2004 at six months old and I lost my still born twin daughters in 2020 after multiple failed IVF attempts . The deaths of my 3 children devastated ne! Those deaths hurt just as much as loosing my son and daughters by the cruel tactics thier mothers use to keep them from me. I’m just so depressed that thier bitterness against me causes them to poison my kids minds. 2 of my 3 marriages ended from my ex wives constantly cheating on me, yet I’m the bad one. I have struggled in life with surviving military sexual trauma when rapped at 17 in the USMC, constant beatings and humiliated by my mother as a child through age 13 , death of my daughters, and extream gender issues and dysphoria, substance abuse and being in abusive relationship. I really did marry woman like my mother. She would constantly beat me, belittle me, make fun of my male genitalia, call me gay for liking feminin things, but also allowing me to have girl toys. I have been confused since I was a child. I now realize most 8-12 year olds don’t constantly think about suicide like I did. I had no idea how to do it. Had the internet been around I definitely would not still be here. I pray someday my kids realize they have been lied to, I contributed over 90% of my income to there mothers some years and always over 60%. I just wondered se Asia for a year on  </p>
<p class="card-body"> $300 a month so the rest of my money went to my kids moms. Why have I wasted so many years bending over backwards only to ge hated by my kids. The kids I tried to hard to make abuseive relationships work just so i could  be with them. Money not everything but I was denied spending time. Most of my daughters lived in a area the military forbid me to live In because of my injuries and lack of hospitals in the area. As a transgender woman I always wanted my own babies as a child, I cried for weeks when my mom told me I woukd never have any. On top of all this I’m struggling with my sobriety, living in Vietnam with a different culture, language barrier and lack of support. People are happy for my financial support, but don’t want people to know I’m part of their family. That’s how I feel. What was supposed to be a family vacation the last summer in Vietnam turned out to no be what I had looked forwards for years to . 😢  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We drove about 90 minutes outside of Da Nang to go seethe  my son Hindu temples. Their ancient Hindu temples built thousands of years ago They were so gorgeous and it’s amazing to see just how far Sanskrit had reached. Influence from India is seen here in Vietnam. traveling in Vietnam as a transgender woman has pretty much been very comfortable experience. Very rarely do people give me any grief to my face. They may laugh at me or giggle or say something in Vietnamese to my wife which really upsets her but compared to how bad it could be in other countries where I could be physically assaulted. Overall compared to the rest of the world Vietnam is a very safe country for LGBTQ travelers. Many people that I interact with really could care less about how I look or who I am as long as I’m spending money, not doing anything wrong, and just being a well behaved expat.  I still feel extremely nervous when I go to use the restrooms, but I haven’t had any issues using the women’s bathroom here in Vietnam, compared to the types of issues I would get in part to the United States. So very thankful for how open minded and progressive most of the country is. #mysontemple #mỹsơn#transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory (at My Son World Heritage-Early 9th Century) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cfu_SCfJGrY/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> My name is Trish, I’ve survived war, death of my daughters, loss of my brother, becoming disabled from combat, and I will survive now! I love life and make my own happiness! I served in Afghanistan, was a teacher, a soldier, and a writer. I’ve suffered in life, been held hostage for 90 days and have the wrong gender on my birth certificate.After tragically loosing my daughters and brother, a severe combat injury and anger I did not understand I turned to drugs and alcohol. I went into rehab in a Veterans Hospital where I transitioned to the beautiful woman I am today. While in the VA hospital I was harassed, discriminated against, and even sexually assaulted by staff. I had to fight, the one thing I’m very good at. I pulled all my strength from past tragedies and survived. After rehab and treatment for my PTSD from the hardship of war I returned to Vietnam to my wife and children. This is my life, my story as a disabled combat transgender female Veteran expat living and traveling through Southeast Asia. #trans #transveteran #lgbttravelers #vietnamtravel #transbian #transgender #lgbtq #lgbtvietnam #expat🏳️‍⚧️ #adventure #loveislove #combatveteran #recoveryispossible #ptsdrecovery #mstrecovery #onedayatatime  (at Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfqJXHBJHqQ/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We went to the golden bridge ( Cầu Vàng) in Ba Na hills  just outside of the Da Nang. It’s works renowned and one of the main attractions in Da Nang, even Vietnam 🇻🇳! So magnificent!When we first got there it was so crowded and so hot. So unbelievably hot. The motorbike ride there was like driving in an oven! I can’t imagine how busy it must’ve been before Covid. As it was you could barely take a picture of yourself. By the end of the day we went back right before they closed and were able to get some nice pictures￼ as everyone had left for the day. So many people asked for pictures with me. I love it when people ask for pictures. It’s always a positive. Hopefully people that hate you wouldn’t ask for one. People always say I’m so friendly, does that mean that they thought I would not be friendly? Some people try and give me a little money. I will not accept money for a picture. Pictures should always be free! Why should I take money for something that makes me feel good about my self? Someone is telling me they like how I look so much they want a picture to always remember it 🥰😍. I love that. So if you ever see me and want a picture with me, of course it’s okay and always free. It was amazing seeing castles and cable cars in Vietnam. We had an absolutely amazing day! #goldedbridgehands #goldenbridgevietnam #goldenbridge #danang #vietnam #CầuVàng #cauvang #travel #adventure #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqtravel #transpride #transveteran #banahills #bànàhills #tayhotrish #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory (at Cầu Vàng - Bà Nà Hills) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfqEBrqJYBv/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I absolutely HATE TIKTOK SO FUCKING MUCH! they are anti LGBTQ, homophobic and transphobic and constantly commit fraud. I have had 8 accounts shut down for absolutely no reason. I am very careful to only use sounds well established. This last time I had accumulated thousands of dollars from fans, then tiktok just decided to keep it claiming I violated community standards for a video I kiss my wife on the cheek. Again they make shit up as they go. I pray a company makes a better app than Tiktok that puts them out of business. It is one of the most hateful platforms in popular use. I don’t think people realize how much they censor content. How they only allow a few lgbtq accounts that they agree are benign. Take a look at the large accounts, they don’t t challenge the status quo. They purposely waited for a busy holiday weekend so shut me down. I have literally invested thousands of hours. For a platform to just discriminate openly like this is ridiculous. TikTok’s openly supports hate groups, some that are terrorist organizations. Let me explain, I told tiktok 6 months ago and every week since that hate groups are targeting me and threatening me, they claim they will report all my videos until I’m deleted. TikTok’s never responds and supports the groups by listening to their false reports, that is supporting criminal activity, fraud, and supporting hate/terrorist organizations. Tiktok is so anti trans, I have had one account deleted for “making fun of women”. They said Pretending to be a woman was against community standards. I told them I’m not pretending! They are so hurtful to accuse me of such things 😭.Tiktok kept me sober as something to do to keep my mind off my cravings. Now it has become a constant issue, a company that openly hates so much should not exist. Yet it does. Tiktok will hopefully either change or go down in flames. Unfortunately it will probably flourish with its message of hate. #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory #tiktoksupportshate #tiktoksucks  (at Hồ Tuyền Lâm, Đalat) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfiFh-MpYYM/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We went to The Valley of love in Dalat, it was nice. We got trapped in the rain for hours.  I’ve still been having a real hard time. Things that I used find pleasure in have been slowly taken away from me one by one. When people have asked for my help I have had to help them on their terms. Then when I need help I don’t feel I get it. I have so little in life that I enjoy, why people can’t just let me have one or two things with out ruining it for me I will never understand. So many people are just plain selfish, in my opinion. People say they want me to be happy, but then they don’t do the things I asked then to do. So it’s really like they expect me to be happy no matter what they do, but not really want to make the effort to help me. I should have learned by now in life to stop sacrificing my life and happiness for others. I have been walked all over and used most of my life. To this day I still am expected to give give give, but what do I get in return? Disappointment and hurt. That’s what I get. When I’m alone I feel less alone than when I’m around those that just take take take.  #tayhotrish #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory #vietnam #tayhotrish #mydigitaldiary #expat #livinginvietnam #transgenderexpat #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We went to 3D world again to get out of the rain when we where in Dalat. That was a hard week. Feel like most times I’m in Relationships my other half thinks they are in competition with me. Anything I try and do that I enjoy gets turned into a competition taking all the fun away. I’m just struggling to maintain my sobriety. Finding anything in life to bring me some sort of enjoyment. People act like I’m off having so much fun when I’m just barely keeping my head above water. I’m truly trying to find a reason to live into my 50s. I was robbed of my 20s and 30s, my 40s won’t last forever . Every day I am the youngest I will ever be. Each day I age another day. My wife had her whole life to be a woman, she doesn’t seem to understand I’m already 43. I’m experiencing things for my first time, I don’t have memories as a young woman being young and having fun. I will never have those memories. Part of me still much prefers the activity’s I was doing last July. I have no idea what’s going to keep from going back to the wrong way of life when I return to the USA. The VA hospital really did not adress any of the trauma that plagues me each and every day. When I look in the mirror and start to see an old woman or my body just hurts to much to walk or move much what will keep me in line. Nothing I can think of. Life is still such a struggle to maintain my sobriety. The fact I live in Vietnam with such draconian laws is the main reason I have my sobriety now, honestly there is not much more to it. I’m dealing with so much anger, frustration and pain about not understanding why most of my life I felt so out of place. What a cruel joke to give me so much potential but place me in the wrong body. I try and be thankful for the great mind and body I do have despite the wrong gender. Being able to walk and talk and not be hungry should be good enough. Unfortunately I’m human and always want more or better. #hugsnotdrugs #onedayatatime #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We spent the day at Vinpearl land. It’s only 750K ($32USD). It may be expensive for Vietnam but nothing compared to a park in the USA with a full water park. In the USA it’s illegal to take away medically necessary water, but they took my special water with electrolytes that I need in this climate so I don’t have siezures. I got so incredibly sick last night after being in the sun with out my medicine, I really wish they did not take it away and just throw it away, really annoyed how things are here sometimes.  I really miss the cool weather of Dalat. I absolutely hate the heat. The sun makes me sick, I get dehydrated and I sweat all my makeup off and it ruins my wigs. My wife used up all my sun screen so we are going shopping today. I love summer in the Adirondacks of New York , but summer in Hanoi is pure hell. I like Hanoi, it’s the weather I don’t like. There is a lot I have been thinking about but have not posted because family asks me not to. I’m still so confused about so much. It seems do obvious to me now what has been wrong with me my whole life. How is it absolutely no one ever talked to me? I had to figure everything out myself. It was an uphill battle at first because of how the VA initially treated me. My first day transitioning they sent me to the hospital for a mental health check. And the patient advocate at the time retired before ever doing anything about my complaint. I was left with so many unanswered questions. Now I live in a country full of ignorance on the subject but at least it’s only ignorance , not hate and intolerance like in the USA, #tayhotrish #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory #vietnam #tayhotrish #mydigitaldiary #expat #livinginvietnam #transgenderexpat #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife  (at Vinpearl Land Nha Trang - Villa &amp; Resort) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfX3enlpEfN/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> The super dumb fucks at tiktok decided to support the hate groups harassing me and they suspended my account for the 10th time. Tiktok@is so transphobic, I wish they got more backlash for how terrible they treat the LGBTQ community, especially during pride month. I have notified tiktok about the threats I get, but they allow hate organizations to abuse their reporting system . TikTok’s in bed with hate groups and it’s disgusting. They have deleted 8 of my accounts every time I get a following. They allow token pages to grow then delete most others.  I had to go for a swim go cool down this evening, I’m  just so sick of corporate discrimination. Every fucking week I go through this bull shit with these dumb ass holes!

				<p class="card-body"> We went exploring ”Tea Hill” just out side Dalat by about 15km. It took an hour to get there by motorbike. There is not much to do, a few photos on the tea farm, a train, wind turbines and a large coffee house with a view. I’m not complaining, I liked it. There is a lot of potential there. It’s been hard because people keep expecting me to have all the answers. Would you ask a 10 month old who they are? I have only been my true self for less than a year. I have no idea who I am completely, I’m still finding what I like and don’t like. I’m still getting used to that reflection in the mirror and the person in my pictures. I love them, they are so beautiful to me. I’m so happy when I realize it’s me , then upset that I waited so long in life. I feel I look old, so old, my youth was robbed from me by an unforgiving society that demanded I fit in a box labeled boy/man. A box I never fit in, a box I hated. And the box labeled girl was definitely more to my liking, it did not completely describe me either. Todays world is brand new to me. So much of my life was made unnecessarily difficult for me. I would have had a much easier and happier life had I been allowed the opportunity to just me me. I’ve woken up in a 43 year old body tgst someone else lived in for 40 something years. I need to make the best out of the time I have left and live my life to the fullest. #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #lgbtqtravel #transgenderexpat #transgenderinvietnam #livinginvietnam #travel #mystory #dalat #dalat2022 #ĐàLạt #Cầuđấtfarm #CầuĐất  (at Cầu Đất Tea Farm) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfShgz3pnUC/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> This is from when we went to the crazy house in Dalat. I miss Dalat already. The Crazy house is something that would fit in Portland,Oregon. It’s so unique with its own personality. It’s a true maze like something out of an awesome anime movie. They have all different themes from under the ocean to a world in lord of the rings. It’s the first place I took my wife when she got here. We had so much fun. The world isn’t perfect, and may seem worse off to some, but 20 years ago I definitely would have been treated much differently. I still have my haters, but they are a small minority compared to those who support me. Thank you so much to all the wonderful people that send be words of encouragement each day. I really appreciate your love. Live and kisses 🥰😘. #dalat #dalat2022 #dalattrip #ĐàLạt #nightmarket #crazyhouse #vietnam #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish #dalatcrazyhouse #HằngNga #tayhotrish  #transveteran #livingtransabroud #mystory #vietnam #tayhotrish #mydigitaldiary #expat #livinginvietnam #transgenderexpat #transabroud #mylife #mytransgenderlife  (at Crazy House Dalat Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfML0iSp7N3/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We made it to Nha Trang!   We left a Dalat this morning and finally made it to Nha Trang. So we left perpetual spring gor the beautiful  beaches and  coastlines of Nha Trang. Unfortunately within the first hour of hitting the beach actually more like 10 minutes, we where robbed. Soon as I handed my wife my purse she was robbed. People must’ve been watching us and marked us because we had large amounts of cash on us for traveling that we took out of the ATM because we needed to to pay for accommodations and a motorbike and all things that you would need for a new stay in a new city. And they And they stole my shoes. My designer shoes. It’s not easy to find shoes i  my size especially not nice designer shoes. I am a size 48, it’s a size 14 women’s in the US. They stole my battery and my iPhone accessories and 10 million in cash that’s Vietnamese dong not US dollars of course. I’m happy I got my passport back my documents my ID my debit and credit cards. We would’ve been so screwed if we didn’t get my purse back. So we had about a good hour pure panic when we thought we had absolutely nothing. I’ve lived in Vietnam five years and never been robbed, in Hanoi i feel much safer. Dalat was super safe . But as soon as we step foot in Nha Trang  we’re tracted and robbed. We’re gonna have to make sure we pay much closer attention when we go to ATMs to see if anyone’s watching us. It feels terrible to ge robbed. I know it’s not everyone, and just one criminal gang working the beach targeting tourists, but you woukd think the police woukd patrol more if they want tourists to return in large numbers. #tayhotrish #vietnamtravel #vietnam #travel  #nhatrang #nhatrang🏳️‍⚧️ #nhatrang🏳️‍🌈 #nhatrangbeach #nhatrang🇻🇳 #tayhotrish #vietnamtravel #vietnam #travel #vietnamvacation #vietnamholiday #travelingvietnamtrans #transgendertravel #transpride  (at Nha Trang Beach) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfJ4OBFp9vO/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Goodbye Dalat. We are on a bus to Nha Trang. It’s really a van. There is absolutely no room for luggage anywhere, and they put me in the back . The seats in the back don’t recline and they  made me put my suitcase In front of my legs so I’m squished like a sardine in this very very uncomfortable van they call a “luxury VIP limousine “. If they did not add seats to were they luggage should go it woukd not be so terrible. Luckily it’s only Supposed to be 4 hours to the coast. Tge pictures are of #freshgardendalat . Vietnamese really like flowers. It’s all it really is, flowers and places to take pictures with flowers. I want to try and say it’s cute, but it’s just different. I can’t think of what to write because I’m in such an uncomfortable seat. I’m a westerner they know is larger then Vietnamese, and they put me in seats 1/2 the size of the regular seats. It blows my mind. All seats should be the same if you charge the same price. Watch out for bus companies trying to sell you the back seats on so called luxury limousine (limousine means van in Vietnamese) . They are the smallest, most uncomfortable seats available. . #dalat #dalat2022 #dalattrip #ĐàLạt #vietnam #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish  (at Khu du lịch Fresh Garden Dalat) https://www.instagram.com/p/CfIw5t8JO-X/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am so far behind in posting. My wife is here but I have not caught up to that day yet. I used to get up at 5 AM and be ready by 7:30. With two girls and one bathroom we don’t get out of the hotel until 11:00 AM, then it rains, then the sun sets. We really need to get up earlier. These pictures are a fairytale land. It’s also a winery. There’s not really a lot to do, it seems like they’ve really scaled back since Covid. It’s still cute and a nice place to go and if you have kids I would definitely bring them there. It’s not very expensive and there’s cute little houses to walk around and explore. There are little underground tunnels there’s nice views. There’s a lot of cute picture opportunities for your family. It was really nice. What I don’t like is when people point and laugh at me, say mean things, then see other people take a picture with me and then they ask. I always say yes, but it’s rude to make fun of me then ask for a picture. Some people thing I charge for pictures. Pictures are always free! I feel good to have my picture taken. If you post online please just tag me with the hashtag #tayhotrish.

				<p class="card-body"> I visited the clay tunnels of Dalat. It was interesting. It was nice to have people recognize me and ask for pictures. I can’t get over how much the area looks like where I grew up northern New York. I have never had any problems using the woman’s bathroom here in Vietnam, but I still get scared. I don’t want to offend anyone. I am a woman, that’s how I identify so it’s the correct bathroom. I woukd be so embarrassed and humiliated to use the mens. It’s such a big deal in parts of the USA. Vietnam seems to understand I just want to use the bathroom. Bathrooms seem to be such a less deal here. Americans Just like to get worked up over nothing sometimes. Once again, thank you Vietnam for treating me with dignity when I have to pee. #claytunnel #claytunneldalat #dalat #vietnam #tayhotrish #ĐàLạt #TransgenderBathroomIssue #transgenderbathroomusage #transgenderinasia #transgenderrights #transgenderinVietnam  (at Clay Tunnel Dalat) https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce6Q6Ikp4g8/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went to yooberi, a Korean soda shop. You pick out your soda and it’s also a place to take pictures. I met some nice  people and we made a video for tiktok together. I’m in Dalat, the coolest temperature in Vietnam and it’s still too hot 🥵 for me part of the day. When I leave Hanoi is going to be absolutely miserable for me. I really don’t like hot humid weather. It destroys me. Living in Hanoi is so difficult for me . Because of the temperature, lack of fresh air and other reasons I get so sick, and my body will hurt everywhere. Dalat is so much more comfortable. If this is the hottest month, then the rest of the year only gets cooler. It’s Friday and we are going to Tea hill. I hope it doesn’t rain on us today. It feels so good to finally get to ge me and experience the world around me. I’m still struggling really bad with being assaulted last year at the Bath NY VA hospital. It’s causing all sorts of problems for me. People that have not experienced it don’t understand what it does to a person. I’m sick of being told to get over it, or when I get blamed. It’ sucks when people don’t understand how hard it can be to get over certain trauma. I’m Trying.

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so sick of writing something out putting a lot of work and effort into what I write only for Facebook to have a glitch and delete all my work. Here’s some before and after pictures at cam ly waterfall when a thunderstorm poured torrential rain down on me. I’m still a few days behind on posting. My wife made it to Dalat okay and should be showing up in pictures soon. I’m still struggling, and I’m sick of people saying ignorant things. If you drink vodka, wine or beer , you do a drug far worse than heroin. I have struggled with many substances in my life, and alcohol is by far the worse. I see people turn in to monsters, black out and not know what they did, say terrible things, hit their partner. Other drugs do not do that. People in withdrawal when they drug is not in their system may do crazy things, but that’s different from the actual substance doing it. Society makes the drug of alcohol okay, but don’t fool your self, it is the most dangerous drug known to mankind. If you drink alcohol, you use drugs. Maybe you don’t abuse it but you still use a drug. Those that know nothing of my injuries, my severe daily pain should not be commenting on my situation. If it makes you feel better to attack me to cover your drug problem (drinking) then you are a hypocrite.  (at Thác cam ly) https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce3U7iJFyHx/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Stopped by the lake today. I don’t know if it’s the weather or what. It reminds me of last year in the USA 🇺🇸. I have been struggling all day with cravings. I keep wishing it was last year again. It’s so hard. It’s good I’m here in Vietnam where I know I won’t do the things I did in the USA. But it’s also so frustrating because of my cravings. I’m hoping they just go away. I wish I could just be content with life. But something in me is drawn to certain bad things. I was told this woukd happen. PAWS, or post acute withdrawal symptoms. I did not realize they woukd be so strong 10 months out. My mind wants to truck me into getting drunk, but I hate that feeling and it will age me. All I can do is take it minute by minute until I can get back to one day at a time. But my whole body hurts wanting what is so bad for me. These cravings suck!!! #easydoesit #hugsnotdrugs #onedayatatime #tayhoytrish  (at Da Lat) https://www.instagram.com/p/CeyiI-3po4_/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Had a great time taking pictures on a rainy day at 3D works here in Dalat. I wish I had come out in my 20s. I used to be so beautiful. I was gorgeous in my teens and 20s. Now I look in the mirror to se me myself age further and further into old age. I’m 43 and can’t believe I waited so long, I’m haunted by this. So much of my life is over. I know I’m still young, but many consider me old. I never got to ge myself in the prime of my life. I will regret that forever. I’m so jealous and so happy for transgender kids that have supportive parents that allowed them to be them. Life may be hard, but a hard life as your true self is better than any type of life that is a lie.  (at Phim Trường 3D World Da Lat) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cev-4D8psf7/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> One of the best things to do at night is go to the night market here in Dalat. They have all sorts of amazing foods, such as avocado 🥑 ice cream 🍦, shrimp pizza on rice paper, BBQ of everything imaginable, and of coarse many local dishes. But he careful, if you over eat you may make your self sick lol I am today. I ate far too much. I was happy to see that unlike markets in HCMC and Hanoi I was not drastically overcharged. Sometimes I maybe paid an extra 5 or 10K, but most times I was charged the same as everyone else. I like that Dalat has set prices on many thinks. Usually the price is visible so you know how much you will be paying. One thing many westerners dislike is haggling over a price. Many times we have no idea what the price should be. I know I have spent far more money in Dalat because I know I’m getting my moneys worth. So when I don’t feel I’m being overcharged I will go out more and buy more things. When I’m overcharged I just stop shopping all together. It’s much cheaper to get around in Dalat. I pay 100k a day for a decent automatic motorbike bike. In HCMC, I thought I was paying 300k for the entire time I was driven by motorbike. In the end they claimed it was by the hour. It cost me 1 million Dong!!! Outrages motorbike scams in HCMC. I could have easily hired grab to go to the different places for under 100k and not been charged while I look at the different places. Places that keep doing this to tourist my hurt the country. Some people only visit a few major cities, they will think this is common all over Vietnam when it’s not. It’s just usually at the major tourist locations. As an American i don’t feel comfortable arguing with people over prices. I Will usually just pay and not go back to the place. #dalat #dalat2022 #dalattrip #ĐàLạt #nightmarket #nightmarketfood #vietnam #transgender #lgbtqtravelers #lgbtqpride #transpride #lgbttravel #transgendertravel #tayhotrish  (at Da Lat) https://www.instagram.com/p/CesR54DJvk3/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went to Bao Dai Summer Palace 3. I did not realize there are multiple palaces here. He was the last emperor of Vietnam during the French occupation. It’s a beautiful palace , more like a summer home. It reminds me of our family summer homes in the Adirondacks and Martha’s Vineyard. I got my TikTok account unsuspended, but I’m so sick of going through this with tiktok, it was blatantly obvious people did it out of hate. People think there are more LGBTQ people in the west than in Vietnam, that is ignorance to think that way. It has been proven over and over again that it’s the same percentage all over the world. In some place due to culture, family, or law people are repressed and can not be free to express themselves . So I see people online that speak bad about me as just jealous. There is something in their life they are too scared to do or could not do, so seeing me happy and free as myself makes them so angry out of jealousy. So I feel pity for those that say bad things about me. I truly feel sorry for them. Happy people do not go on a fun app to criticize others. I am not forcing anyone to watch me. They may block me completely and never see me again. And the people tgst lue about me to tiktok, they are the safest , most unhappy people in the world. I feel terrible that that hate life and themselves so much. #BaoPalace #dalat2022 #dalat #ĐàLạt #vietnam #baodai  #baodaissummerpalace  #baodai #dinhbảođại #bảođại #tayhotrish #tây #TravelingTrans #lgbtvietnam #lgbtqvietnam #transpride #lgbtqpride #iloveme #queer #lgbtqtravelers #travelblogger #travel  (at Dinh Bảo Đại - King Bao Dai Palace) https://www.instagram.com/p/CenLW9hJHOF/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went to The Valley of love or TTC world. Its called a theme park, but not what we woukd think of as one in the USA. More like the roadside attractions of the 1950s In the USA. It started to rain so I only saw half. I’m going to take my wife there when she gets here to see the rest. Lately my Subutex is pretty much out of my system. I am craving substances fo much. I think about them constantly sometimes. I’m dealing with people targeting me. Ignorant stupid people think it’s okay to point at me an scream. I crashed my motorbike today. I hurt my leg and harm and bruised then both badly. Broke my phone and hurt the bike. A woman pulled right In front of me on gravel. You can’t Brahe normal on gravel. I could not believe she just drove of. She did not care I crashed, was Injured, broke my phone, broke my bike, and it was all her fault from driving directly in front of me on gravel. The pure ignorance and selfishness of some people just blows my mind. People that pointvand scream like I’m so discussing abs scary just show how incredibly stupid and ignorant you are. Sometimes I can not believe the complete lack of manners of sone people. My 5 year old kids behaved better than some people I see each day. It’s made up for by the majority of Vietnam that is highly educated, and posh with manners. Truly most people are great examples of humans. So the small minority of absolute idiots I meet each day I just ignore. I’m a human, there is no need to yell and scream and point at me. Do you have any idea how stupid you look when you do that? #TTCWorld #valleyoflove #livingtransabroud #mystory🏳️‍⚧️ #vietnam🏳️‍⚧️ #tayhotrish🇻🇳🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 #mydigitaldiary🏳️‍⚧️ #🇺🇸expat🇻🇳🏳️‍⚧️ #livinginvietnam🏳️‍⚧️ #ĐàLạt #dalat2022 #dalat #vietnam #lgbtqpride #transpride  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I visited the crazy house of Dalat. I loved it. It was absolutely awesome. I had no idea it would look this way. I love how awesome Vietnam is. This woukd never be allowed in the USA. Remember in the USA, you could get arrested and you children taken away if you drove them on your motorbike if they where Uber 8!years old. It was a little scary walking the narrow stairs with now safely rails and the wind blowing so hard. I am was called a ghost by one woman, and I asked her to stop calling me “ma”. I don’t think she knew I coujd understand her. Sometimes I feel so good because 99 people say nice things, then that one person is mean and I get so upset. I need to remember 99 people said good things, and just ignore the 1. I don’t like being laughed at either. How many people are too scared to do what they really want in life, too scared to tell the person they live how they feel, too scared to tell their parents what they want to be. So many people that laugh at me have no idea the things I have seen. I survived over 10 years in the Army of a country fighting 2 wars. I survived thousands of miles or roads with IEDs and people trying to kill me. I survived a combat injury. Why then am I bothered by laughing? I’m just not used to being laughed at. In the Army I was respected, I did my job well and was not scared of dying. I deserve to finally live the life I want to. I gave so much to my country, I don’t owe anyone anything anymore. I’m Happy, and some people hate that. They are just jealous.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Dalat Main Cathedral or Da Lat Chicken church is the largest Catholic church in Dalat. I was raised Catholic and I still feel a pull to attending mass every Sunday. Done Catholics try and talk down to me and say I’m living in Sin. I have yet to hear a priest tell me that. I am married with my wife. I am faithful to her and I keep the sabbath holy. Wear exactly did the Bible say anything negative about being transgender. In fact transgender is talked about in the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 22:5. But that does not apply to Catholics. It is the same rules that would keep me from eating pork or sleeping in the sane bed as my wife when she has her period, or have tattoos or wear cloths with mixed material. Deuteronomy laws DO NOT APPLY to Christian’s.  In the Bible Eunuchs are mentioned, they would fall under transgender in todays world. Jesus mentions eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, where he notes that there are many kinds of eunuchs, including “eunuchs who have been so from birth,” “eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others,” and “eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven”. So Jesus not only speaks to transgender 🏳️‍⚧️, ge condoned it in itself. Certain practices may still be considered a sin, but that gets murky. Am I living in sun because I am a Gay woman now? But I guarantee if I was with men, that would not be accepted either. Some people just want to hate what us different, what they don’t understand, or what they wish they could be but are too scared to be. They hate the most out of jealousy.

				<p class="card-body"> I went to beautiful Datanla Waterfall. I loved the roller coaster that took me to the bottom. It was absolutely amazing. It kept looking like it was going to rain, and the weather app kept saying the same. I wish I had stayed longer but I was having a hard day. That day I was trying to enjoy nature, but because of modern day cell phones people kept interrupting the peacefulness of nature. Sometimes I miss the 1990’s before everyone had cell phones. When we first got a car phone I thought it was so cool. Little did I know how much cell phones woukd change our lives. People afraid of vaccines having microchips in them to track them forget most people are willingly tracked by their own cell phone and multiple apps. I also really love my iPhone and everything I can do on it, so as we say in English it’s “1/2 a dozen one way, 6 the other”. Meaning it’s equally positive and negative. Dalat is just so beautiful. I would definitely live here if I could. So far in Dalat people have been so nice to me. Only a few ignorant people saying bad things to me. But 98% has all been positive. Vietnam is by far more friendly than many other countries in the world including parts of the USA when it comes to how the trans community is treated. I understand it’s different because I am a foreigner, but done countries woukd refuse service to me. That has never happened here’s. I love you Vietnam!!!😍❤️💕🇻🇳 (at Datanla Waterfall) https://www.instagram.com/p/CefMep0J0eo/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I arrived in Dalat on Wednesday but is has been a very busy end it times stressful week. I’m really enjoying my time in the lot. The weather reminds me of back home in the Adirondacks of New York. Getting here was a challenge. When I left Ho Chi Minh City I was supposed to go south but the company took me to the middle of nowhere and just dropped me off and told me to wait for a bus. The bus never came and I was afraid I was going to have to sleep outside. Eventually an old man came by and called a bus for me somehow.  I thought the bus was going to a city in the south but it end up going to Dalat.. I had fallen asleep on the bus and so I woke up and was already in Dalat. Happy pride month to everybody. I hope everyone is living their authentic life and not worrying about what other people think. Life is too short to try and please other people. don’t live your life for others live it for yourself. You don’t wanna live a life of regret. Don’t wait for tomorrow to come because it may never come start today being who you really are. I regret waiting until I was 42 years old to be who I really am again. 42 is better than 52 and 52 still be better than 82 if I live that long. #dalat2022  #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtrans #lgbtqtravelers #travelingvietnam🏳️‍⚧️ #lgbtqvietnam #lgbtvietnam #transveteran🏳️‍⚧️ #vietnam #dalat #ĐàLạt  (at Thành phố Đà Lạt) https://www.instagram.com/p/CebUe4upOqc/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> For Memorial Day I went to the war remnants museum. Despite the politics of my country’s involvement in the Vietnam war, I can relate to the soldiers and other military members that served in Vietnam. I’m sure many thought they were doing the right thing. As an American i had an image put into my head growing up that any side my country was in must be the right side. Who does not want to believe in their country. After living in Vietnam for 5 years I feel I have a much better understanding of what it was Vietnam was fighting for. It truly wasn’t communism, it was nationalism. A free and independent Vietnam. so much of my countries struggle for independence is echoed in Vietnams struggle. The American Declaration of Independence was referenced in there independence letter. I was sickened by seeing the atrocities that happened in the war. It’s hard to come to an age an realize I gave my youth to the military industrial complex to further American imperialism. I was never fighting to keep Children safe it to better another nation in the long run. Just short term gains for the wealthy elite. Those that start wars , profit and benifit should be the ones at the front lines. It’s a never ending story. The poor fighting the agenda of the wealthy and privileged. This in no way diminishes the sacrifices of those that died fighting for what they believed would bring a better tomorrow. What was in their heart is what matters. thank you to those that gave everything for our country 🇺🇸 . Happy Memorial Day, and never forget. SPC Ryan Grady will always be remembered as one of those that gave everything.  (at War Remnants Museum) https://www.instagram.com/p/CeNm2D3pJBK/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had a great time at the summer anime expo 2022 here in HCMC! I have been following anime and manga since I was in Highschool in the 1990’s! OMG I’m old. back then only a few people liked this Japanese subculture. I wanted to look like sailor-moon as a child. The internet was too slow back then to stream anime. We would have to wait until midnight certain days on Cartoon Network to see any anime. And a few times a month they would have movies. It was a very different world back then. It was a very happy environment at the festival. I’m so happy people can just celebrate what they like. Everyone had such amazing outfits. Thank you to everyone that welcomed me. Please tag me in any pictures you have of me @tayhotrish . I live in Hanoi so I don’t know if I will be at other festivals. Send me a schedule because I want to come to the next big one. #summeranimeexpo #animeexpo #TPHCM #hcmc2022  (at Summer Anime Expo) https://www.instagram.com/p/CeKV0OtvbQ6/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Welcome to Ho Chi Minh City. After the fall of Saigon (Sài Gòn) the city was renamed. It’s strange seeing the connection to my country of the USA. The remnants of the occupation here, as in Iraq, and Afghanistan. There is so much infrastructure built by the USA, abd repurposed. There is something magic about being back in this city.     On a different topic I have been feeling overwhelmed. I feel like I’m supposed to apologize for who I am. People act like I have turned into a different person, I am the exact same purpose only sober and happier. I just happen to dress differently. I no longer feel bad for the things I like. I felt bad for liking dolls, pink, dresses, doing my nails, make up, etc. I’m so glad society is changing. I still run into so much ignorance. People talk about things they are uneducated in, my gender is not my sex! My gender identity does not define my sexual orientation. Why does it matter? I hate I have to defend my sexuality. Are people so ignorant that if I was pansexual or bisexual it woukd mean I woukd leave my wife for a man? Being Bi or pan does not turn you into a cheater . People are harassing my kids and wife. Asking stupid questions that are none of their business. People actually try and tell me I should change my style of dress or that I should change my makeup!!! I can’t believe people. I dress for me! I wear makeup to cover my burns and scars. It helps my gender dysphoria. If people have questions they can ask me, don’t ask my wife or kids.

				<p class="card-body"> Hello everyone, I am in the city formally known as Saigon. Today it is named HCMC (Ho chi minh city) . It is much more progressive than Hanoi. But I was treated pretty well in Hanoi . I’m exited to see the southern part of Vietnam. I have not been here since 2017. I. Still in my early days of recovery. I’m still not over being raped. I can’t connect with people. I don’t want to be intimate. I feel I am going through the same ordeal many woman do all the time.  I have been raped twice now. Once in the Marine corps at 17, and again in a VA hospital in 2021. The first one absolutely destroyed everything about me. I never dealt with it and it destroyed my life a few years later. I don’t want my life to blow up like that again, I’m so stressed. When you are trying to find a reason to live life, and gave meaning, it’s hard for me to care. I just stopped caring last year as all.  Well I’m off on my next adventure in the Mekong delta ! </p>

				<p class="card-body"> On the way back to Hanoi I encountered some insanity. A truck was broken down on a bridge in Ha Nam. As i was crossing a truck smashed into the broken down truck pinning the first driver that was behind his truck , under the second truck. I ran over to the unconscious man. Diesel was pouring all over him and the hot pavement. The truck that hit him was a fuel truck. I had no idea if it was carrying  gasoline or diesel. In my mind that truck was going to blow up at any time. Despite realizing I would most likely not survive the blast being so close, I continued under the truck to pull the man out. I carried and then dragged him to what I felt was a safe distance. To my surprise I found a pulse, and his breathing that had been very shallow stabilized . I stopped tge bleeding and went to get help. Thank God when I returned he was conscious and walking. He was in absolute shock. I checked him over. He had a bad head injury I redressed. But no broken bones, no signs of massive internal bleeding. No abdominal swelling. I know you should not move people with head injuries, but when Diesel is poury out of a fuel truck I felt I had to get him away from a definite fatal situation if it blew. I was so frustrated that no one seemed to take my concerns seriously. He kept trying to sleep and people where okay with that. They seemed to get upset I kept wailing him up talking to him so he would not fall asleep and possibly unconscious with such a bad concussion. I hope he is ok. after a few hours I think his family took him to the hospital. Other people posted about this on TikTok, once tiktok saw positive publicity about someone transgender, they removed it and threatened to ban me 4th time! Tiktok is so discriminating!

				<p class="card-body"> Spent the day at Bái Đính Thursday , seeing all the amazing temples. I had a great week in Ninh Bình. I live escaping Hanoi. Hanoi is is crowded, hot, thick air. Don’t get me wrong, I love Hanoi , it just becomes overwhelming. Do escaping to the country is great. Vietnam is so diverse. I spent a week in Nihn Bihn and did not see even 1/2 of what I wanted to. My wife posted about our relationship and it blew up on tiktok. Since I am tagged in her videos and I tag her in mine it got a lot of traffic. 2 million. There are a lot of ignorant comments. If people wonder why I don’t mention or talk about here her, it is because prior to a few days ago, she had asked me not to mention her. So I respected her privacy. People are making so many assumptions about us, with out knowing anything about our personal life and the full story of our relationship. I don’t mind making my history public, but I’m not going to bring up my wife’s, that’s her private life and she can keep private what she wants. All people need to know is we love each other. At Night when we go to bed, after I shower and take of my clothes. I look exactly the same as when we got married. Gender and sex are not the same. I identify with the female gender. My sex anatomically is male. So for medical purposes my sex is male and my gender is female. Sexual orientation has absolutely nothing to do with gender identity! I did not wake up one day and become a female. I have identified this way personally my whole life. It was indulged as a child, but then not tolerated later in life. I was forced to repress who I was. This ruined many aspects of my life. In the USA after loosing so much I decided to start over as my true self. This does not mean I am now attracted to men. I can see a man and know he is attractive, but I am not sexually attracted to men. I am attracted to other women. I am a gay transgender 🏳️‍⚧️ woman, a “Transbian”. This  doesn’t change. I was born this way. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #transveteran #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtransgender (at Bai Dinh Pagoda) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdzV9Vopu-V/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so absolutely disgusted, hate groups attacked LGBTQ accounts on may 17th the international day against trans,Bi , and homophobia. Tiktok permanently banned another account of mine. It’s ridiculous hate grouped have so much power to destroy peoples hard work and lively hood with lies. And there is zero recourse. I still have not heard back from when the deleted my account that documented my transition . It sucks that a company like tiktok is able to support hate and I’m told to leave if I don’t liệu their policies. It’s one thing when some ignorant idiot try’s harassing me, but when a whole corporation openly shows their support for the anti-LGBTQ movement it’s scary. They don’t follow there own guidelines, and have double standard for mainstream vs minorities and LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I’m terrified as my account grows they will just arbitrarily delete me again. I hate something like that bothers me and I wish it didn’t .  Well at least I’m enjoying Nihn Bihn and all the beauty it has to offer. I hiked this mountain in Platforms. The views are amazing! #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran  #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransgender #Vietnam #tiktoksupportshate #tiktokhateslgbtq #tiktokhatestransgender (at Phố Cổ Hoa Lư - Ninh Bình) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdtCZ2JJU8K/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Spent a beautiful day in Nihn Bính. I went on the River ride at Tam Coc. It’s a shame it was overcast but it was still beautiful. At Mau Hang I was walking in the lotus field, when I stepped on a board, it snapped and next thing I was in the water 😢 😭. Surrounded by I think German tourists, not a single one offered any help or said anything. If I saw a woman fall of a defective bridge into the sludge below I know I woukd help them. Oh well. I can still smell the yucky mud and it’s probably fertilized with manure, possible even human waste. I was covered, absolutely covered in muck and had to drive 10 km on my motorbike on an unusually cold day. I spent hours in the shower. I spent the night with chills and do sick from what ever was in that field. It’s strange, most Vietnamese are so friendly to me, ask questions rather than assume and are mostly very polite. Yet sometimes with western tourists I get this look of disapproval. I do also get the occasional enthusiastic supporter that I really appreciate. I forget that some people may see me and think there is something wrong. I was always so self conscious of how I looked it what I was doing when I was Patrick, but as Trish I am so comfortable with who I am I don’t think twice in hesitation of who I am. I’m just so much more happy now. So when people ask me why I dress like this or look this way, we’ll it’s because it makes me happy and it’s not hurting anyone. If you can’t say those two things about how you dress or who you are, then maybe worry about you and not me. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransgender #Vietnam #ninhbinh #ninhbinh2022 #tamcoc  https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdoy8SdP2qt/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Yeah! I did it! I loaded up my motorbike and drove south to Ninh Bình! ITs been hot all week, and then it was actually cold today, so I bought a “Grab” jacket. “Grab” is the Uber/Lyft of Vietnam. Most of the motorbike taxis have the same green jacket, so done people looked confused seeing me drive wearing one, and I hooked my phone stand up to the battery do it charges like they do as well. just getting out of Hanoi was half the trip it feels like. The roads are fairly decent and I could travel 60-80Km/h for long stretches. So far I have not had any issues here. I was able to check into a nice Hotel, walk around, eat and people where friendly towards me. I had to deal with some naughty children that just kept screaming the f-word at me having no idea what it means. Well looking forward to done great photos tomorrow, this area is absolutely beautiful.  (at Phố Cổ Hoa Lư - Ninh Bình) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdlUQ0SJb7Z/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Another beautiful day in Vietnam. But it was so hot, humid, and raining. Trying to decide where I should go next week? Where should I go! A. Ninh Bình B.  Hạ Long Bay (Vịnh Hạ Long) or C. Somewhere else. I was thinking Ninh Bình first, then Hạ Long later. The weather is supposed to cool down on Monday. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransgender #Vietnam  (at Hanoi, Vietnam) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdis7R5JglI/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> So yesterday evening after I went to my AA meeting at a coffee shop near Hoàn Kiêm lake, I waked to the lake. As i got to the lake an 45-58 year old Vietnamese man proceeded to attack me. He grabbed me very hard, groped me, and attempted to pull me away from the lake area. I am twice his size. It was very unsettling. This crazy man was screaming at me, based on other peoples faces, saying terrible things. He was trying to kick me out of the lake area. Based on the words I understood he was accusing me of terrible things, and prostitution. The police came. I was hoping something would happen to the man for hitting me and attacking me, but no, the police questioned me, talked to my wife. Then just left. The man was very upset that the police would not arrest me just for walking around the lake. The police wanted to know what I was doing, I had my wife explain, just walking around the lake like everyone else here. They where fine with that. Because the police man was so young (23?) and the man that attacked me older, I think out of respect they just told him to leave me alone, I hope they at least said that. Being attacked in a public place, doing absolutely nothing wrong shoukd not be tolerated. There where many families that wanted a picture with me, have their children practice English with me , or just admire my dress and hair. I dress how I dress because it makes me happy. I don’t charge for pictures, or ask for money. I am retired from the U.S. government with a decent pension. I spend a lot of my money here in Vietnam. So again 99.9% of the night was wonderful. That hateful man, probably drunk did not ruin it. I’m thankful for all the nice people that apologized for that man’s behavior, and let me know he did not represent their feelings towards me. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransgender #Vietnam #hoankiem #easydoesit #Hanoi2022 #hanoi  (at Hoàn Kiếm) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdhxdXRLIUH/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I went to the glass bridge. Khu du lịch Cầu Kính Rồng Mây. Kinh May Cloud Bridge Resort is located at the Gate of Heaven at the top of the beautiful O Quy Ho Pass 2,200m above sea level, 16 km from Sapa town . I had an amazing time. I Had my picture taken with well over 100 people. I wore my “Giay” outfit that I bought at the market.  I spend the day enjoy the view and the last of the cool weather. It’s back to Hanoi with the hot humid and hell like weather combined with choking pollution. I really enjoyed spend this past week in Sa Pa. I have finally learned how to enjoy my self sober. I actually love who I am, and enjoy living. I was so miserable most of my life not knowing or understanding why. When I had my kids I was happy, but I had them ripped away and I got blamed and told I left after an injury from a deployment. And the military made me happy and I was forced to retire. I was happy for short period ls of time , but was always let down and I stopped relying on other people. Finally I am okay with myself and just trying to be me, and please me. Life truly is to short to worry about other people that don’t contribute to your life in a positive way. I’m so happy that returning to Vietnam has been so positive. I have had my battles, but I survived and made it to another day. Thank you to all the wonderful people that support me. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #lgbtqtravelers #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransgender #Vietnam #caukinhrongmay  (at Cầu kính Rồng mây) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdSfYbpL2co/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Spent a beautiful day exploring Cát Cát again. I was wondering why do many people had such beautiful outfits, turns out you can rent them at the entrance. I wonder if I was charged more for being bigger and western. I paid 400k for the day. Based on the amount I can’t see so many people paying that. I don’t mind, it was well worth it and woukd have cost far more than $20 in the USA.people don’t realize I am pretty good at understanding numbers in Vietnamese and know when people ask the price. Many times I do hear a price 3-5X higher. In Vietnam i can either agree, haggle for a lower price or go to the next vender. I understand I make far more than the average local, so I should pay more if I’m going to live in a socialist Republic, and I have no problem doing that with in reason. I don’t want to ge gauged. It’s also nice because people know it would be bad business to be mean or disrespectful, so I have always been treated respectfully and with kindness when it comes to local business. It’s terrible that on my home country some people hate other people so much because of the color of their skin or other silly reasons that they won’t do business with them. Many people around the world have told me they think that’s so stupid and crazy to not make money over not liking a person??? I fear today will be my last day in Sapa . It’s been a week and I have to go home someday . #transgenderabroud #transgenderexpat #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtranswithtrish #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #hanoi #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi  #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #tây #chuyểngiới   (at Cát Cát - Khu Dl Cát Cát) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdPU-1Upsrc/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I was supposed to leave days ago , but I’m living it here so much that I don’t want to leave. I Really regret that I lived in Vietnam for so many years but over COVID I did not leave my house in Hanoi most days. I want to see Vietnam as it is today, for tomorrow it will be gone. The country is changing so fast, my own neighborhood in minh Khải looks so different since the light rail was built. The people of Sapa and surrounding areas have been so wonderful, kind, and loving. Every barrel has a bad apple, but very few can be found here. I have been treated with respect and dignity everywhere I go. Many people also ask for pictures. Some as like a freak show, but most because I am beautiful. I look very different as a foreigner, I am tall with blue eyes, not a sight seen everyday since COVID . Then I do dress my own style hat even xan turn heads back home. Well one more day at least to explore this beautiful area.  #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #transgenderexpat #transexpatvietnam #lgbtqvietnam #livingtransinvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #sapavietnam #catcatvillage #CátCát #lgbtqtravelers #transtraveler #tayhotrish #travelingtranswithtrish   (at Sa Pa) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdMvsljpaGt/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We had a great day on Tuesday. So much fun I’m two days behind in posting. My wife’s bus was too late so she got to spend another day with me. I love this cool weather. Going back to Hanoi will be so hot. I get such mixed reaction. I tears my heart when every so often I meet someone that is just so supportive and kind it feels like they may be more than just an ally . The population is changing so quick here in Vietnam. The younger generation has grown up plugged into the world. I may get some boys that giggle or don’t realize the English words or middle fingers true meaning, but over all a very supportive generation. It’s typically older men, that seem to get upset because I think they are attracted to me, then get a closer lo and are confused. It seems immediately after an insult they want a picture with me. I truly can not complain about Vietnam. I know I am definitely experiencing western privilege, and white privilege. A privilege very different here. Vietnamese are overall very respectful and they usually do not want to be insulting, since I come from another culture, they refrain from publicly criticizing me, or insulting me to my face. I can live with that. Also in the USA people may be refused service for who they are, despite laws to protect minorities. Here in Vietnam, no one, I mean no one has ever refused my business. I may get charged more “western tax”, but that’s normal. So far Hanoi and Sa Pa have been great and supportive of the T+Q part of LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈.   #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #transgenderexpat #transexpatvietnam #lgbtqvietnam #livingtransinvietnam #lgbtqpride #lgbtqtravelers #transgendertravel #lgbtqvietnam  (at Sa Pa) https://www.instagram.com/p/CdKA1tdPGja/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> We had a great day traveling around Ta Van village, outside of Sa Pa, Vietnam . It is in the mountains with higher elevations comes much cooler temperatures compared to back home in Hanoi. I received many compliments and everyone treated me with respect and love. There was confusion on the pronouns, only because of language and culture. The indigenous people of the area speak Vietnamese as their second language to their native tongue. In Vietnamese there is only Vợ for wife and Chồng for husband. There is no gender neutral word for spouse or partner like in American English . In more progressive parts of the USA, husband/wife has been replaced with partner as to not force a gender identifying word to ge used. So we have decided to use Vợ for my self. I am Vợ, and my wife is Vợ. This was confusing at first to some, but in less than 10 seconds they grasped the concept and had no issue with honoring our request to both have female pronouns used on us. In Vietnamese there is not really an “I” like in English. It changes depending who you are. So when I speak I use the pronoun ”em” or “Chi” immediately letting people know I identify as a woman (using em could still be masculine if speaking to an older person) . COVID 19 has absolutely devastated the area. The locals depend so heavily on tourism , that seeing westerners return to the area, the kind willing to open their purse and buy things was welcomed with open arms, and how I looked, talked, or identified really did not matter to them. I am very sure I was definitely the first transgender person that many had ever seen in real life. Like I said at first it was confusing just because it was a new concept to some, once explained it was like “okay, whatever. That’s cool. Go shopping , buy from me???” </p>
<p class="card-body"> We secured a motorbike today also making travel much easier than walking, I can’t believe I used to pay to trek. Basically just walk all day. #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #transgenderexpat #transexpatvietnam #lgbtqvietnam #livingtransinvietnam #transgenderinvietnam  #chuyểngiới #sapavietnam #tavanvillage #lgbtqtravel #lgbtqtravelers #TransTravel #transgendertravel </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so sad, my demon slayer mask fell out of my pocket and it got grabbed and taken before I could walk to it and pick it up off the ground, tons of other masks litter all over the place but of course my mask is yanked before my eyes angry 😤 😡. Well we made it to Sapa. It’s cool and damp. I’m trying. I’m really trying hard. I just can’t force things that aren’t there. I’m still less than 1 year old as Trish. Sometimes my answer to questions will be “I don’t know”, because I don’t know or understand everything about my self. I went my whole life being told I was sick if I thought a certain way, to one day waking up and not carrying what people thought, and it turned out many people did accept me.  I thought Vietnam woukd be death to who I am, but it has turned out to be a far more tolerant country than I feel people led me to believe. I thought I would be spit at and have garbage thrown at me most days. That has been very very rare. I can’t change who I am, and I hate when people I care about embarrass me or make me feel bad about myself. Even if they don’t do it on purpose it still hurts so much. I’m in the rural part of the north of Vietnam, among minority tribes of Vietnam. They have been very nice and kind to me. I like that they too don’t care what I look like, only if I want to “go shopping, go shopping now” as they keep asking me. Tomorrow is a new day. Most of today was great  and started so well, but a few coarse comments can destroy it all. Almost no one in the world can make me feel bad , I don’t know why I give other people so much power over me, then when they act like I don’t give them enough attention or power it makes all my sacrifices feel for nothing. I used to be a sick person that would let people walk all over me, use me, expect them world from me with out giving anything back. When people get upset “I changed”, I think that’s the part the upsets them the most. I finally love myself and i come first. Always putting other people first in my life got me nowhere but last </p>

				<p class="card-body"> This is me and my wife. It has been a very difficult past year for us, between being separated due to COVID, ne going into rehab, and me coming out public as transgender. Our two cultures see things very different on the two issues. There is so much misinformation in Vietnam about what it means to be transgender . It is still viewed as a mental illness by some, that I am a sick deviant that will do terrible things. That because my gender identity changed, my sexual orientation must have changed as well??? None of which are true!!! It was a very confusing time because of all the negativity and ignorance out there that influenced her. We have had our rock bottoms where we woukd end things to where we are now of at least trying. I love her, she loves me so I feel we can make it work. I am the same person, only sober, happier, and my true self. I’m so nervous out going out with the kids for a holiday lunch today. It’s reunification day. Celebration of the liberation of Saigon (fall of Saigon in the USA ) 'Ngày Thống nhất'. I’m so nervous. I wish immigration to bring my family was not in its 4th year. the USA immigration system is broken. It’s so much more difficult explaining things while here in Vietnam. I’ll update more later. We are going to Sapa for the holiday weekend!!  #fallofsaigon #endofvietnamwar #MayDay2022 #reunificationday #reunification #ngàythốngnhất #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #transgenderexpat #transexpatvietnam #lgbtqvietnam #livingtransinvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #lgbtqhanoi #transgenderhanoi  #chuyểngiới #transveteran #lgbtqpride #transpride </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Here Is where I live. This is Tây Hồ (West Lake). It’s where I get my name from, the neighborhood I live in. It it one of the more upscale parts of the capital. it’s very posh. I have many of the western comforts of home. I also live in Mihn Khải at my house. Currently so I can get to ny AA meetings easier and deal with the heat better I’m staying at our apartment. The fresh lake air keeps the temperature moderate and it feels less polluted. I’ve been back in Vietnam for 2 1/2 weeks now. Being a western transgender woman has been difficult but I’m sure I am granted privilege for being a tall blue eyed westerner. I imagine things are so much harder on a local . Overall people do not harass me . They do say unkind things in Vietnamese thinking I can’t understand them, but I understand words for ugly, monster, ghost, crazy and such. My money had been good everywhere I go. No one I have given my Business to had been mean. They have been very kind. So I repeat my business over and over again to those shops and restaurants that are very supportive. They ask me how I am, tell me I’m pretty or beautiful. Complement me. People may tell me that they are just saying that for my money and don’t believe what they tell me. How is that a bad thing??? Have you been to the USA where people have been refused service for the color of their skin or being LGBTQ??? There is absolutely nothing wrong with complimenting me and treating me kind for my business . It works. Many places in the world could learn from Vietnam. It’s not perfect, but for such a traditional society it has been very accepting. I can’t speak for all of Vietnam yet, but I can say Hanoi is very LGBTQ friendly to the expat or tourist alike. In genuin has mostly been children, drunk men, or very old ugly women jealous of my beauty that have been unkind to my face. This is the rare exception. In return I try and represent the trans community by turning the other cheek to insults, and standing my ground firmly towards the extremely rare hostility. I stand imposingly tall over the average Vietnamese, and I’m well built and in shape. I’m not the woman you want to mess with. I do not travel to seedy areas in the dark and stay in well lit crowded areas for safety. The main challenge is my poor wife harassed by ignorant idiots in her family and work that say the most discussing vile things, call me a pediphile , mentally ill, a pervert, a criminal, basically the worst of worst. I can’t believe such ignorant people are allowed to work at universities here. In the west they woukd be fired on the spot for such ignorant backwards way of thinking. People that ignorant shoukd not be teaching the next generation. #lgbtqhanoi #transveteran #transexpatvietnam #transexpat #lgbtqvietnam </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Well I’m a year older, and I’m no more the wiser or maybe I know far more than I ever knew. I know I am the real me. This is who I am. I feel like some people thought maybe I would change when I left the safety of my country. My response woukd be I was never safe in my own country. My country is very dangerous and viewed that way all over the world. Are there people here that don’t like me, don’t agree with me? Yes, sure there are. But do I feel some people hate me so much they woukd try and end my life? No! I don’t get that feeling in Hanoi. I feel the uneducated, ignorant and older population are confused. The closeted LGTBQ Vietnamese are either jealous they can’t be themselves or they are very supportive. I can tell that those that make the biggest deal And seem the angriest are either gay or trans themselves and so upset . Then I see the younger generation of Vietnam, the country’s future. They are well educated, informed, and open minded here in Hanoi. They have a passion for life and respect diversity. The will be the generation demanding equality on the world stage. To demand such a thing one must be willing to give it as well. Life is not easy, despite how easy my life may seem, it is far from it. I appreciate that at least I Am understanding who I am a little better each day. </p>

<p class="card-body"> I’m getting old , I’m 33 years old today (give or take a decade). Spent the night at Hoàn Kiêm lake after going to my First AA Meeting since returning to Hanoi. I felt pretty good. The theme of the meeting seemed to be about not accomplishing a lot in life. I’m disappointed because I truly feel I could have done absolutely anywith my life and I wasted (wasted is to harsh, it have me s lot of benefits) it in the military. I’m proud of my service at the same time ashamed. But I have definitely done a lot and accomplished a lot relative to the average person. Reflecting on my birthday I’m sad in getting old. I wish I had been able to be me at an earlier age. I was so beautiful in my teens, 20’s, and 30’s. Now I get called a grandma by children on line. I can’t blame my parents they had no idea in the time they raised me. I was considered to be a problem child . No one understood the anger I had inside of me boiling over. I distinctly remember telling my mother on many occasions I wanted to be a girl and being told that was “gay”. Sometimes she thought it was cute when I wore my sisters clothes, but any further attempts Where called “gay”. But I was not forced into any strict gender roles of the times (1980’s). I had Barbie’s , cabbage patch dolls and other dolls. Was allowed to play with a doll house, play with girls as friends instead of boys. I just hated the sports pushed on me, but that had nothing to do with gender. My mother was just s jock. It was just hard being told about how great woman where /are, the oppression they suffer, and the fight for equality, then at the same time being told I was that oppressor, and gay was a bad thing (I never really questioned my sexuality, but if gay was bad , trans was not going to be accepted). I was constantly told I was a white male part of the club that fucked up the world. A lot of mixed messages. Things could have been better , but I’m thankful because I guess they could have been a lot worse. Thank you Hanoi!!!!! So far 80% of the people I meet have been awesome, kind, and supportive. Or at least nice enough not to spit in my face. I can’t blame Vietnam, that happens just as much if not more back home in the USA . Love you Vietnam!!! </p>

				<p class="card-body"> . I have been so lucky in life. I was born into the upper class in a developed nation with an ethnicity that gave me great privilege and the gender to put me at the top of the social hierarchy. Yet I have been miserable most of my life. I could have had almost anything I ever wanted in life, accept to be accepted as me. Only when. I play the part of a man named Patrick do I get told I worth anything to those I look up to. It hurts so much to be told by those close to me I need to feel bad for them because they lost the person they loved. A fake character that never truly existed. It was on a construct made up to satisfy society. I finally know who I am. I am Trish. The beautiful woman I fantasized about being my whole life. No one truly knows how close I came after buying a gun on the streets of downtown Rochester to ending my life . It was in a brief moment a call came in that my step brother had a heart attack, and later turned out to be a brain aneurism that killed him did I deviate from my plan to end it all. Instead traded the weapon for narcotics. At that moment my path I would take was locked in place. It took trying to hit Rick bottom with out actually dying to allow myself to be reborn the woman I love that I am. Sadly I feel I’m the only one that truly loves this version of myself. It hurts to be told that people in this world are still so small minded, ignorant, uneducated and just plain stupid as to believe there is something wrong with me. just want what the can get out of me. No one wants to be constantly reminded that they are not valid to part of the world. What ever happened to people just doing what is right because it was the right thing to do. Sometimes it seems to me that people need the are left with me. Not a perfect person, but a person that tries their best, is honest and loyal. What can be said about those that all they have is a façade of being a good person. When at the heart there is no true good or kindness, just an expectation that they are owed. For people like that I have no more tears to shed. It is hard people have wished for such a (at Hoàng thành Thăng Long) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cchm5MHrUgm/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I arrived safely in Vietnam and have spent my first week here already! Thank you Vietnam for being so welcoming!!!  Yesterday I spent the day at the beautiful temple of literature in Hanoi. I loved the scenery. I took advantage of the weather finally being a bit cooler. If you see me in Ganou, feel free to ask for a picture. I don’t mind, I think it’s a silly question I get asked, so I will answer it now. I do not charge for pictures. It is free. If you want a picture, it is my gift to you. I will try and write more and pist more about my experience being The “T” In LGBTQIA+ abroad. “T” standing for Transgender. I am also “L and Q”. Meaning a lesbian as I identify as a female and am married to a tensile. And Q for Queer. I AM NOT A DRAG QUEEN! many people here confuse this. I do not dress up as part of a performance or in an attempt to attract men. Thus us just my style of dress and living. I’m Queer and proud. I always have been and always will be. Many people have asked if I’m scared to be this way. Well I’m a retired infantryman and truck driver from the US Army and survived my last deployment to Afghanistan where I suffered a combat injury giving me a TBI with medical complications to this day. I survived a war of weapons, bullets and bombs. Now I’m fighting a new war. A war for my right and the right of other LGBTQIA+ humans to exist and thrive in peace. It is a peaceful fight with actions and words rather than the barrel of an M-16 A2 or M4. People that do choose to try an use violence against me will quickly learn I have been well trained in self Defence. I’m not that girl you want to mess with. I only use my skills defensively, never offensively. But I do believe in Defence of a third party, an extension of my right to self Defence. I am a kind peace loving girl. Show me the respective deserve and it will be reciprocated. 🏳️‍⚧️ 🏳️‍🌈 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇻🇳💕❤️😘🥰  #transgenderabroud #transgenderexpat #🇻🇳expat🏳️‍⚧️ #travelingtrans #travelingtransgender #travelingtransveteran #transveteran #hanoi #lgbtqhanoi #lgbtqvietnam #transgenderinvietnam #transgenderhanoi #vietnam #veteranabroad #lgbtqcommunity #LGBTQIAPlus #lgbtqia #queer #lgbt #lgbtq  (at Temple Of Literature) https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccgr3KdvgVf/?igshid=NGJjMDIxMWI= </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Part 1 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Well I left the United States 🇺🇸. I was discharged from the Coatesville VA hospital with out signing a single discharge paper. No one went over my meds with me when I got them. Just seemed like no one took notice. . I’m almost to Korea. I’m not really looking forward to the reception I may be getting in Hanoi 🇻🇳 . Everyone has loved my beautiful Áo Đại. But one person in my life is not happy with what I’m wearing. I think I look beautiful. Most people that talk to me say the same. I was completely ignored by the flight attendants on Korean Air. They kept calling me “mr” or “sir “ no matter how many times I corrected them. I had ordered a vegetarian meal. They would keep skipping over me at meal time. I heard them off my vegetarian meal to someone that did not make the request then told me they did not have any left and did not apologize for giving it away. In Korea at customs they were beyond inappropriate with me. I say many Korean woman that were older go through with their wigs on. They knew I was screened at JFK. They highly embarrassed me. The forced me to remove my wig, remove my chest, and took many of my medications I was prescribed. I was so embarrassed. The forced a man to pat me down until I absolutely refused it. It was not even customs, it was just the transfer people. I felt very harassed. No one else was publicly humiliated the way the staff at Incheon airport humiliated me. In both JFK and Noi  Bai in Hanoi treated me with complete respect. No one at customs in Vietnam made me remove anything but my mask to see me better. All I can say is both Korean Air and Incheon airport have a long way to go with how they treat transgender passengers. I rate them as </p>
<p class="card-body"> JFK TSA workers 9/10 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Korean Airlines. 5/10 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Incheon Airport 2/10 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Noi Bai airport 🇻🇳 9/10 (they did a great job considering the cultural differences. If you knew how different I look on my passport you would understand) </p>
<p class="card-body">  Part 2 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Once I arrived in Hanoi everything went smoothly. I did not have my health declaration online because the app did not work at all. They uploaded it from me. I was cleared through customs with out indecent, and picked up my luggage. Many people asked for pictures while I waited to get my luggage. Once I left the airport and was picked up by family, things went south quick. I should say north, way north because of how cold the reception was. In Vietnamese culture i was met with the lowest big low greetings. No eye contact, no hug or even hand shake. People pulled away from me when I tried to hug people I have not seen in over a year . I felt horrible and disgusting. Perfect strangers had treated me far better than those that supposedly love me. 😢. #noibai #lgbtqvietnam #TravelingTrans #transgenderinvietnam #KoreanAir #incheonairport #noibaiairport #transveteran #livingabroadtransgender #lgbtqveteran #queerinvietnam </p>

				<p class="card-body"> What the fuck Facebook!!!! I. Do sick of you fucking deleting what I write and not fucking saving it!!!!! I’m so upset to be leaving Coatesville. All my fellow female veterans made me feel so well. I was in an all female program. Do different from the transphobic backstabbing bitches in Bath. Those female veterans traumatized me. Ignored me, and called me terrible slurs. The Administration there allowed tge hate to go on and supported it. People look at segregation and wonder how people could be do small minded. Well most of the females at bath had the same small minds with the sane hateful reasons . I suffered great trauma because of them not  yo be protected on a locked unit of my gender. No one ever did anything about Bath breaking federal law and forcing me to be housed in the opposite gender, Allow a sexual assault and multiple other assaults. My PTSD is 10 X worse because of Bath NY. I still have not received the help I need </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so upset that one of the Drs has persistently been checking my room in the morning. Why can they do this when they want something but could not get me services? Why was a in promised a dentist? Why did other veterans get in ahead of me? Why did I never get an exam in person by a physician that I requested? Why was I denied an extension when other veterans got extensions. Why had it been 4 days I’m reporting I’m bleeding heavily in the bathroom yet no one has seen me? I never got over being raped in Bath NY. I was not pushed to talk about it, but it bothers me constantly. Why did I do a safety plan? I said Iam  suicidal . I won’t do it myself but I will do It. Why do a relapse prevention plan? I said I still will use as soon as I can. I have not been rehabilitated. I’m going into a very hostile environment. It’s a perfect storm for terrible things to happen. I truly do not understand why I did not receive any help at all in my GI bull being reduced, money being taken out of my pay. All sorts of things I needed help with. I needed help with memory because of my TBI, I did not receive it. I made it clear I can’t touch paper Print-outs. I can’t write, yet almost no effort was made. I was forced to stay in a program when other people Got to switch. I worked with people I did not know. I’m so disappointed that litterly nothing was accomplished here.

				<p class="card-body"> Hello I have less than a week before I fly home to Hanoi Vietnam. So I’m trying not to get caught up in drama that happens here while I’m in patient. I celebrate eight months clean tonight. But there is no meeting that I feel comfortable going to here. I was never OK to have a women’s group and I was never OK to start refuge recovery. Are the recovery groups are not going very well Coatesville really needs the monitor the group‘s better. Highly disappointed in how that is gone. So I’m learning valuable lessons. One thing that I’ve always known and never questioned is how I feel about at what point do I deserve a quality and what things do I just not deserve because it would be unfair. I now understand when I would see on TV shows and minorities especially people of color would have to talk about how they had to work twice as hard as a white counter part in orders to succeed that things weren’t just handed to that. And I get that as a wasp things were very easy you know I got a lot of what I wanted just because of how I looked. I mean I might I’m educated. but things are much more difficult being a transgender woman.. And sometimes I have to be very resourceful. Damn TBI the word that I want to use escapes me. I lose words all the time. I have to be delicate with how I say things because I have to remember I’m inpatient in veterans hospital with other female veterans that have issues of their own. I can’t hold them to the same standard I would hold staff or hold the regular person on the outside world. I also understand that while my gender is female and identify as a woman my sex is still male I have the body of a man. I am a big tall strong man body. I would never ever use that advantage to my advantage. I have the right to argue and banter with a cyst gender woman, I can argue with her with my words. What I cannot do is raise my voice and deep in it to remind them that I have  The body of a man. That is just unfair intimidation. And when I see other people that identifies similar to me use tactics that I feel are unfair it truly upsets me. I would never ever offensively hit a woman and very rare situation would ever be defensive it would be an escalation of force enough to maintain my ability to stay conscious and alive. In a non-combative role in my life is not on the line I do not feel that would ever be a situation why would have to resort to that type of violence. With a man yeah absolutely hands-down I would fight a man if it needed to happen. But I would absolutely never threaten her intimidate another cis gendered woman. But how do I feel about a transgender woman while it truly depends I guess in my eyes there’s a sliding scale and you know you might not like this you may say it’s an appropriate message should see them all equally. I don’t and I can’t. Some I see him or masculine of the others more feminine not saying how I just peoples correct but I’m not gonna sit here and lie and say I don’t do it so there’s a line my head where I would still consider buying them as fighting a man in the line Road so I know that’s me hitting a woman. I’m so glad that I am here and the other female veterans of been so kind and welcoming to me I like them so much and it has allowed them the defense of no we are not anti-trans we are anti-personality because I am transgender I am treated fine. They I see them treat everyone the same some people don’t like other peoples personalities and take it to mean something it doesn’t . I hate to see people use the trans card saying all people are being mean to me because I’m transgender. When that’s not the case and people just don’t like you. You lie you telling people you go to the authorities you are just fucking annoying it’s your personality you’ve been given advice you choose to ignore it time and time again. I realize you’re impatient just like me getting help so I </p>
<p class="card-body"> . I realize you’re impatient just like me getting help so I get you’re not I can’t expect you to be a perfect person. But don’t be using your gender identification is the reason people don’t like you. And you didn’t want to take advice from people so don’t be upset she still not excepted. So besides the situation here at the Villa Maria very difficult time with family life with my home life I hate when people bring in the opinion of absolute idiots it’s. Please don’t bring in the pain is someone that is so beneath me so uneducated that of course I wouldn’t expect them to say anything positive about me they’re ignorant dumb idiots. I could pick from people in my country that would say horrific things about anyone that’s not a white straight Christian. But what will be the point of talking about idiots. And it’s unfortunate but anyone in the educated world knows being homosexual or transgender is not a mental illness and only highly highly uneducated people say that. You can disagree with it from a moral standpoint and keep it to yourself and keep it within your family. I have no say how you conduct your family but if you say that it’s a fact for everyone in the world you are highly ignorant . I mean I try not to insult other cultures but there’s some messed up things that go on in other cultures that is just plain wrong. Female genitalia mutilation. That’s absolutely wrong. I so yeah I’m involved in another culture but that doesn’t mean that that culture is equal to mine when it comes to certain moral stances. When you do not treat people with dignity and equality you cannot hide behind your culture or your religion you are just plain wrong. And the more you try and cling to it being your culture or your religion or something else the more of an idiot you look like the educated people. It’s one thing to not know any better you know to have not learned the difference that’s not an idiot that’s ignorance but if you have access to the Internet you can blame how you were raised you see how the world is and you should be able to understand the science behind things. So I’m happy that everyone in my family then connected to a smart enough to understand that people that say negative things about me I just truly ignorant in Jealous Haters. There’s people that I’ve always talked bad about me always talk negative. They just super jealous I mean I’m an American and I’m really good looking am highly educated I am well off.  People are extremely jealous so they will try and talk me down at every point. But they don’t get is the more they talk me down the more their embarrassment to their country. This is why some people are very ethnocentric. They seem very ignorant people make very ignorant statements about transgender and homosexuals anyone in the LGBTQ community you are speaking I’ll of your self.  #transveteran #lgbtq #lgbtqveteran #queer #queerveteran #coatesvillepavha #veteranshospital #transgender  #transgenderveteran #inavahospital #inrecovery #ignoredbytheVA #needhelp #soalone #stopthe22 #lgbtqandconfused #disabledcombatveteran #lgbtqrights #lgbtq #lgbtq🌈  #lgbtcommunity #loveislove🏳️‍🌈 #loveislove❤️💛💚💙💜 #Specialmarriageact #gaymarriage #samesexmarriage #Banconversiontherepy #adoption #surrogacyc </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Hello e! I am so stressed. I leave for what I hope is still my home in a week. I was all happy and all excited that I had finally bought tickets until tonight when I was brought down. I am so stressed and worried about everything in my life. I’m pretty much alone and everything that I do. I really wish I had a little bit more support. If somebody kept asking to go coffins shopping with you. Or to pick out a gravestone, what would you think. You would think that they think you’re gonna die soon. Why else would you be picking out things for after you die. Same issue I’m having with someone. They wanna talk about something and there’s no point to talk about unless they want to do the thing. I beg the people not to talk about it not to bring it up. But they bring it up anyways knowing it will ruin my week. Some people in my life act as if I had the freedom to live my life. I don’t know what they mean by that they act as if I am is a choice. I hate how people think it’s something I can turn on or off just because of how are used to be. I hate how people trying to find what I am. I am my own self. There is no one like me and I am like no one. I may share similarities and characteristics but I am unique. Like I said I was really excited and happy to go to Hanoi. I really thought I had more support I’m hoping I do. And I keep getting mixed messages I feel like I was told to do one thing and then when I say I’m gonna do do people get mad that I want to go somewhere. people get to talk about things they wanna talk about is it oh well what if we need to do this, but I’m not allowed to talk about places I wanna go with the same thing happens it’s a double standard deocrisy. I know it’s late I need to get some sleep. Good night kisses to everyone. #transveteran #lgbtq #lgbtqveteran #queer #queerveteran #coatesvillepavha #veteranshospital #transgender  #transgenderveteran #inavahospital #inrecovery #ignoredbytheVA #needhelp #soalone #stopthe22 #lgbtqandconfused #disabledcombatveteran #lgbtqrights #lgbtq #lgbtq🌈  #lgbtcommunity #loveislove🏳️‍🌈 #loveislove❤️💛💚💙💜 #Specialmarriageact #gaymarriage #samesexmarriage #Banconversiontherepy #adoption #surrogacyc </p>

				<p class="card-body"> How do you like my donut  🍩 eyes? It my first time trying to do it. I’m never very good at anything I do my first time . So I bought my ticket and it’s off to Hanoi in a week. What’s so insane is that it will cost me more money to go from Coatesville PA to JFK airport in NYC than my ticket to Vietnam 🇻🇳. But the two combined are still cheaper than trying the nightmare of flying out of Philadelphia. It would take 54 hours to get to Hanoi and cost $3K vs the $900 to fly out of JFK and only 21 hours flying. It’s insane that the VA will not provide me with any transportation help. So I have to get a $600 Uber to take me to the airport. So F*ing insane. So I just completely maxed out my credit cards again. The government is recouping $1000 a month I don’t owe them, I only get half my rent money as I’m paying off debt from getting stuck in the USA and my credit card interest alone is $500, not touching the principal. And now I need to pay out of pocket for all the medical and dental procedures I could not get done in the 8 months of being inpatient in Veteran Hospitals 🏥. There is something very wrong when you are inpatient and can’t get your needs met. I still have not even been able to see a dentist. Really what is the pint of having dental if you can’t use it?? VA medical seems to go smoothly for certain people that are so fake it scares the VA not to get them things. Sons people here got here a month after me, got appointments right away and I still have not seen anyone to even give me a console. Some of these are my combat injuries from 2010 I need addressed but can’t get done. I actually feel </p>
<p class="card-body"> Like a woman , a female veteran because my concerns along with the other female veterans are ignored. We all feel we are being housed with a predictor that is using the system. They violate all sorts of rules and there are no issues. Why we get told our safety is their number one concern when it obviously is not. Just so frustrated . I feel Have not been able to have any visitors for the past 8 months. So I will return to Vietnam without seeing my kids. But other people have sexual escapades off campus and the system looks the other way. Complete double standard. So many double standards I would have to write a book to get yo them all.  #transveteran #lgbtq #lgbtqveteran #queer #queerveteran #coatesvillepavha #veteranshospital #transgender  #transgenderveteran #inavahospital #inrecovery #ignoredbytheVA #needhelp #soalone #stopthe22 #lgbtqandconfused #disabledcombatveteran </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so pissed . Stupid Facebook erased a long rant I typed out. I’m too exhausted to rewrite everything. WTF FACEBOOK???? Stop deleting posts and making me rewrite everything. I was talking about how difficult things have been for me here. I will try and write tomorrow.

				<p class="card-body"> Well I feel so disappointed. I have not receivedy the majority of the services o needed from the VA. I flew around the works, speabt almost 9 moths inpatient and coujd not get my most basic needs. Patient advocates don’t return my calls. I woukd not be so bothered but I see people working the system with made up conditions. I feel they are just milking it. I am in absolute constant pain, i will definitely need some sort of narcotic pain relief for it. I’m still super confused about my gender and everything as. I’m so frustrated at the moment. I feel in truly being treated like a woman. But why is it that you you look like, act like, and talk like a man but claim to be a woman you get everything you ask for. I really feel let down. The VA broke me in bath when I was raped. I was really expecting more help at the VA here in Coatesville to make up for that? I don’t understand why I’m being rushed out when I never received any of my accommodations for my classes. So I never actually did any meaningful treatment as I coujd not participate with out help that never came. ?#Transgénero #transseksuelle #transgenres  #transznemű  #transseksualni  #Biànxìngrén #transrodna #transsukupuolinen #Toransujendā #transpersonas #transseksuell #transpłciowych  #transgêneros no #trawsryweddol #chuyểngiớ #трансгендер #المتحولينجنسيا #跨性别 #トランスジェンダー #트랜스 젠더 #ट्रांसजेंडर  #טרנס'נדר #τρανσέξουαλ #แปลงเพศ  #ટ્રાન્સજેન્ડર #تغییجنسیت#տրանսգենդեր #ເພດ  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am feeling very alone tonight. It was a rough weekend coming off of my sublicate. That’s basically a buprenorphine  shot under the skin.￼ i’m been thinking about how little people have contacted me since I’ve been in the hospital now for eight months. The way the counselors and doctors explain things to me in the hospital is that I have a disease like somebody with brain cancer, a tumor. Throughout my life I did strange things acted weird because I suffered from both the disease of addiction and the struggle of having a body that didn’t match my gender.￼ Add multiple traumas I suffered such as sexual trauma, rape, loss of children, and other things along the way, life’s  been easy and life’s been difficult.￼ throughout everything I found out I really don’t have the people I thought I had to rely on. I feel I would be able to put certain things aside if somebody really needed me and could just be there for him and tell them whatever they needed to hear to feel supported to feel comforted￼. Instead of constantly arguing or fighting. That’s why I feel so alone, I have I will call VA friends meaning friends I have one in the hospital these are people that I’m gonna follow throughout my life. There’s just someone for support while I’m in the hospital. Besides my dad I am feel completely alone and my dad doesn’t even really want anything to do with me anymore.￼ he still supportive if I talk to him but it doesn’t feel like I really have them to talk to. I never had a mother. That’s kind of hard. Honestly seeing how other people talk about their mom, I’ve never had that. I had somebody that showed strong dislike almost a hate. How all the other people have good memories of their mom I can’t think of money, even my earliest memories when we were just alone and I will try and process it was met with something negative. I never feel I got one real compliment or encouragement.￼ on a separate topic, I have told everyone in my family I have to leave by April 10th, I don’t know what people think tgst means. It clear that if I don’t have a ticket to fly somewhere I will just be flying to someplace I can afford. Tickets to Poland are on $180 while tickets to Hanoi are over $1000.  I still have the stupid government stealing $1000 a month out of my pension. They claim they overpaid me, but they never did. I was not paid any money in the National Guard after I Received compensation. I o my got retirement points. They are not worth any money since I was medically retired. I also still have money for my insurance for my ex being taken out. It drives me crazy. Then another $70@ goes to my dad for the past 8 months. Then I’m also paying child support twice for two kids that are also collecting my social security. So that’s another $800x I’m left with about $27 after I pay my bills and minimum credit card payment that just keeps up with the interest. I well what ya gonna do. The government can’t steak forever, ;yes they can. Here at Coatesville I am getting far bette care than Bath, NY VHA, but not as good a care as others. I have severe memory issues. It’s in my chart. I can’t write (I can type). So far I have not seen my primary care doctor in person, Bố occupational theory, My walker is still broken, no dental yes (I am 100% service connected and entitled to dental). They left a 3rd empty socket in my mouth when I shoukd get a bone graft </p>
<p class="card-body"> . No help with my government debt issues. I’ve been asking for certain things for 8 months inpatient at the VA that I still can’t get. If I could ever remember anything I woukd be asking all the time. It’s just so disappointing to still be treated like I don’t belong. Then not allowing me in the power program for woman and forcing me to stay in ptsd I thought was because I was transgender. Then they let someone in my opinion that has no issues for power in the program. In my mind the person does not meet any of the most basic requirements. I have to deal with hearing them talk about how the milked the system and where not completely honest. It sucks because the person is dangerous in my eyes. They keep find So this has been me this past week. I’m detoxing of Sưboxen. I’m gettresdyvtibeityer go home to Hanoi or fly to Eastern Europe to help in the war effort. Unfortunately I did not receive the help I needed at the VA. My discharge date is April 10th with no leeway. The program I’m in is shorter than the power program I wanted ti be in but despite my best effort was denied. In the grand book it clearly states power is a 3 month program despite staff telling me it’s 27 days. Yet everyone else is getting 3 months. I’m lucky I’m so beautiful. With out my looks life will suck as I get old. What’s going on in Ukraine is killing me. I will sacrifice how I look in order to serve a greater good. But people say the have a ticket for me for the 10th of April. I will just have to wait and see. I’m still so confused on who I am. People keep acting like I’m supposed be proud of them for accepting me. That’s like a basic human right. And I’m not sure how I feel about being around people that still want to hide who I am. I feel any friend that says I can’t be who I am, does not truly put me 1st. It’s okay, I just wish they would say it. I hate People pretending like I’m so important to them but they constantly put others ahead of me. I’m just really disappointed. I blame most of my issues in life on three people. Myself, my mother, and my sons mother. I’ve connected all my problems to myself of course and then those two women completely destroying my life and family. Setting me up to never trust and settle for less. So much anger around all those things. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Hey everyone happy Saturday. I’m still in the Coatesville VA. I’ve been detoxing off of my supplicate, Suboxone shot. I just felt like I had the flu for the past week. They want me to finish out the last two weeks of my treatment detoxing. I guess I don’t even have two weeks which is kind of scary.  I have to decide what I’m gonna do. Am I gonna go to Poland and cross into  Ukraine or am I going home to Hanoi. I miss my wife and kids so much. But at the same time I don’t feel like I’d have any support if I went there. It’s just that people don’t seem to understand me , how important certain things are to me. How hard life is on me already and I am so alone. It’s one of those things where there’s some people in my life that I just can’t talk to you anymore. Maybe if I’m face-to-face around family members again it will be different. But the way it is right now,  they don’t understand that I’m the same person but look different. And regardless of how I look I would change from being in rehab.  I’m trying to deal with issues here and rehab of how I deal with transgender women. I’m completely excepting of certain transgender women I’m accepting I guess attractive men that you can tell used to be I shouldn’t even say that transgender women that look handsome as a man and I haven’t been aren’t passing as a woman. and then I feel there’s a category of people that don’t really meet the full criteria for being a transgender woman in my opinion.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Maybe this is just jealousy. But it’s been my experience now that if you don’t quite look the part of being transgender and whatever that means . I’ve just been having a real hard time at the VA. So maybe lotta this is just jealousy. I feel because I’ve been accepted as a woman I’m being treated like an actual woman which is good. But if you don’t act like a woman you still act like a man but kind of dress like a woman you get special treatment. I guarantee you any women here were having sexual relations with a man while in the program they would be talked to but there seems to be different rules for different people here. I have a real hard time with hypocrisy anyone that’s right when I’ve written over the past six months we’ll see how much it bothers me. I feel there should be absolute quality and that includes the rules. And I have noticed for some things  I get away with not following certain rules that the women get told they have to. I don’t know if it’s just that some staff is  afraid to say something to me but it’s minor things. but then there’s some pretty major things that I just would never do that I think other people are getting away with. And it might have more to do with the insults that I’ve gotten from some people I shouldn’t say some people, a person. It’s just one person that drives me absolutely crazy.I don’t know why I’m not trusting my gut. My gut has always been correct on people, it’s never once been wrong. And I’m being given a “warning warning Will Robinson danger danger danger”. To stay away from this person and I do stay away from this person. But every day for the past week this person finds some excuse the corner me in the laundry room which is like a bathroom. its very uncomfortable . I feel like I’m getting ready and I’m being watched by a man.  I don’t like it it bothers me it makes me feel very uncomfortable and the person says it’s a public area it’s a laundry room they have ever my right to be there which I guess they too but they’re finding an excuse at the exact time in the morning to watch me get ready and I don’t like that. There’s just something about this person that rubs me the wrong way and I can’t even function in classes. Anything that I’ve said about myself the person then takes and sets up stories where when it’s my turn if I was to tell my actual truth it would sound like I was one upping them. It’s very rare that I’ve been so annoyed by a person. But no one sees what goes on behind the scenes. All my other fellow female veteran see it and they’re frustrated as well. There’s one act goes on for the staff. And then there’s what we have to deal </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m loving my UK 🇬🇧 makeup I did on my eyes today. It matched my whole dress. It’s hard for me. I don’t like being put in a box, to describe who I am . But I find myself putting other people into boxes to describe them. I still have a major issue with extending gender to just words someone says. In my mind there are gay men that like to play dress up once in a while. Or will dress very neutral where it’s not very feminine. They mistake attention from other gay men as approval of their femininity when it a man being attracted to another man. I see a lot of people I run into think that having bottom surgery some how makes one more woman than those with out it. All these labels bother me, so I feel twice as bad when I label others. I am trying to be supportive of other women veterans and only take what all woman veterans have acres to. I feel there is a rift forming when transgender veterans put what they want ahead of tge cis -gender veterans. This is a sure way to cause problems in the veteran community. I see it happening now. I realize no matter how much I think I’m explaining if, some people are just selfish and will never integrate until they can work as a team and not just take . I’m still super upset tiktok is lying about my accounts. They refuse to help me because they hate lgbtq, they support Russia in their invasion since every video I make to raise money for the people of Ukraine is suspended.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I love my strawberry skirt that finally arrived. It’s been a hard day detoxing. I’m feeling very upset over not really getting anything out of this program here. It’s all the little things I asked for in Januar I have not received. Referral to neurology, dermatology, OT, and in person with a PCP. I have not seen a dentist, I did not get my bone Graft. I lost 3 teeth while in the VA directly related the the VA being so slow. My walker is still broke, i can’t get a Tablet, i can’t write and I have yet to receive any digital copies of hand outs. I have also requested many other things in Bath that I doubt I’ll see. I’m stressed so many staff are using he/him/his fir ne because they are only super careful around cvç. It’s been one month since I asked for a key.  (I’m so tired, I’ll finish in the morning) </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Tiktok permanently deleted my account because they support hate. I was targeted by a church group of evil. They said they would burn me alive, said I deserved to be raped . I reported it to tiktok and tiktok said they did not violate the user agreement. I was told that by making video responses to the hate group , and addressing the hate speech I was violating their community guidelines. So basically tiktok supports hate, they are racist , homephobic, and transphobic. The refuse to allow people respond to the hate. Then tiktok also supports scammers that target people that loose thier accounts. Tiktok is violating so many laws by prominting hate speech while banning others. I am so upset. Please if you get a chance go to : https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Ask them is unban @tay_ho_trish  </p>
<p class="card-body"> “Dear TikTok , please unban @tay_ho_trish  . They did not harass or bully anyone, they where bullied and called terrible names, yet you ignored it. It seems you support hate and do not support tge LGBTQ community. Please reconsider @tay_ho_trish  account, as she deserves her account back. You have devastated her. If you don’t unban her I will not use the app and tell my friends how you don’t listen to the vulnerable people being discriminated against a </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Wow TickTock is a fucking piece of shit. I have a church group target me that racist trans phobic and homophobic. They’ve been targeting people in the LGBTQ community and people of color. They emailed me that they were going to get me banned they made up lies about me and end up getting banned. Tick-tock just banned anyone that has a large following that’s not making the money. I’ve been so depressed since I was raped by a staff member of the bath New York veterans hospital. I was told to let my anger out on social media. So I’ve been keeping track of my days on Facebook and Instagram and TickTock has been my outlet. Yesterday I lost all that. My one out to deal with all the anger all the sadness all the loss all the hurt. Was taken away from me by some bullshit fake church that pretends to be Christian but it’s really nothing more than a hate!!!! Then Tik Tok allows people to post with known scammers, I had no idea that I was being scammed. They seemed like legitimate people working with TickTock to get your account on banned. I thought I was getting legitimate emails from TikTok that I had to pay them. I’ve lost $5000 to these fucking scammers, then they hacked my bank account and took the rest of my money. I have absolutely nothing left I can’t believe. Instagram really needs to get rid of hosting scammers. Seems to be a safe haven for people ripping off vulnerable people. And then I’m dealing with bullshit here at the VA I’m at I try my hardest to set a good example for the LGBTQ community especially transgender community. All I can say is that I feel there’s certain other people selling the movement back in decades. The women I am with a horrible taste in their mouth from someone that’s not me and it’s just destroying tge community. I have tried so hard the past weeks to deal with the bullshit going on here. But over the past couple days people the person has tried to set me up bad talk me call me names too shit behind my back. All of us are just fed up with this one person so F and sick of them. But they get protected nonstop by staff. They get services the other female that can coon myself do not get. I am so upset that consults were just put in the past few days. That a lot of services I thought I was patiently waiting on nobody got ready for me. I haven’t seen a doctor yet in person. I have not seen occupational therapist yet. There’s so much I haven’t even seen yet yet other people have multiple appointments a day. I am beyond frustrated that certain someone gets special attention and special treatment when I am left in the fucking dust. it shouldn’t be the most fake person that just happens to scream the loudest be the squeaky wheel gets everything and people that are legitimate and true to who they say they are get fucked over. It’s not as horrible as Bath New York. But literally my only bar is oh I’m not getting raped and I’m house with a woman so yeah that’s as high as my bar is. When you’re in constant fear for your life, life sucks. So that was the only standard I had to say that it’s good here in Coatesville is that I don’t have to worry about my life. How sad is it that is a disabled combat veteran in order for me to say this is a good hospital the bar is literally that . Literally it’s a good VA because I’m not being raped. That’s pathetic. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> So I’ve done a lot of thinking about it. I’m made up my mind and I need to head over to Ukraine. Is the time when it just doesn’t feel right to do nothing. It hurts sitting here doing nothing. I could’ve done so much with my life, gone down a different path, but I joined the military after September 11. A lot of people did what I did. Never knowing what our full potential would’ve been have we stayed on the civilian world. I can’t change the past I can only move forward. I knew who I am I know who I was and I know who I want to be. I also know who I don’t want to be. I can’t stand to be the one on the sidelines living a safe life while others don’t have that luxury. so I started the process to try and enlist in Ukraine‘s for in defense force. It was started by the president in order to have the capacity in their military for foreign fighters. And that is currently my goal, where I am going to head towards. people ask if I have to put who I am on holds, the answer is now. Who I am in the inside will always be. And like in a time of war, any war for anyone throughout any time, people have to sacrifice some things that they want for things that they need to do.   </p>

				<p class="card-body"> So tomorrow I go to Philadelphia to have an operation on my sinus cavity. I’m having a root removed. It’s a tooth that would’ve been fine had the VA in Bath New York fixed it eight months ago like they were supposed to. But on top of removing two teeth that should’ve come out, they never fixed my tooth that they were supposed to fix. So they just kept putting a temporary on it until finally just fell apart here in Pennsylvania and yet another tooth loss today due to the VA and that’s complete incompetence. The sides that I realize I am a strong beautiful transgender woman. I get hit with heat all the time. Even within my own community I have a lot of people that are very jealous. I am lucky to be as intelligent as I am, to realize who I was in my 40s why I still had a great looking body. And extremely handsome men make very beautiful women. I feel bad for the people that were either and ugly or not so good-looking man or woman because when they transition to be a man or woman they are still just as ugly. And it shouldn’t be about what’s on the outside it should be how you are the the inside. What’s unfortunate is people that may not have the outer looks don’t understand that you can be a beautiful person and everybody’s mind if you were just a good person on the inside. Those the project beauty from within are the most beautiful on the outside. What’s unfortunately sometimes there are people that are just ugly to the bone. They not only  look bad on the outside there just bad as well. Although I need to not rush judge to quick maybe some people just have a lot of issues, and it causes them to see my backstab Lane, sniveling little bitches. I can’t help the judge it’s human nature. I feel as long as I keep an open mind and always challenging my thoughts, it’s OK to judge in the way that I’m willing to reconsider that judgment. But everyone does it every day it’s impossible not to. I am trying my best to give people the benefits for the doubt. But is becoming more and more difficult as we discover peoples true colors. As much as we try and give people the benefit of the doubt we are coming to find that some peoples true colors are despicable. Overall I don’t know what I’m gonna do my family really want me to come home to Vietnam and I really wanna jump on a plane to Poland. I need to get Ukraine again anyone with any information please contact me. And people that tried calling me a messenger I can’t answer while I’m in the hospital it rings but it won’t answer. I don’t have strong enough Wi-Fi. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Compared to bath I’m having a much easier time. But I have come up with some recent issues. I’m having problems with one particular that Jen, but so is everybody else on my floor. There seems to be two extremes bath New York was too extreme in One Direction cocktails to extreme in the other. I am learning that there’s no perfect solution to many things and I just have to adapt. Some people are just extremely jealous of how smart and beautiful I am. I understand for some people and they see how easy my life seems to be what it truly isn’t. How beautiful I am as a woman how handsome I could be as a man how my intellect is far superior than anyone else’s here, it’s very intimidating. So I just need to let it slide when people try and call me names that are signs of obvious jealousy. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> So I’m trying my best to adjust to the diversity of the LGBTQ community. It’s very difficult because I feel the VA is very binary you either a male version or female version you must choose between the two. I personally feel there are people that do not fit into those categories and do not belong in certain areas but Sơn must’ve done a find a certain way to the where they need to be.￼ I am so angry at how Seantreated me at the  Bath New York veterans Hospital and  domicilery. If only they could see how they interpret the transgender rules here in Coatesville ￼ they would see how terrible they treated me. I constantly tried to explain to Sean that at any time a male veteran Could open their mouth say I identified as female they could continue to look like a male talk like a male,  dressed like a male and they would have to be let over on the female wing .that dumb asshole allowed a few stupid women that were transphobic to￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Feel that they had the right to say they didn’t want me on the female wing. They had absolutely no right . By Sean allowing that transphobia they completely violated my rights and VA policy. I was absolutely humiliated discriminated against and dehumanized by Sean at the Bath Vé. And we need it didn’t help much either. But I’m trying to tell me some of my clothes and was inappropriate or distracting then absolutely no right whatsoever to tell me that either. They were completely in the wrong. Now that I have been to Coatesville and I have been explained how crazy Sean in Bonita were think if they could talk to me the way they did and tell me the things they did. They had zero rights to do what they did￼￼￼. It just blows my mind that the things they got away with saying to me, how they spoke to me and how they thought the rules were. I am so angry and I am having to go through so much counseling just to deal with the trauma that Sean put me through. That man constantly belittled me when I got called in the office sitting in a power Authority of position not letting me get a word in. I’m so happy that the administration here in Coatesville is helping bath administrators be reprimanded and hopefully have them educated so that no one is ever treated the way I was it has to go through such a humiliating dehumanizing experience like the one I suffered in Bath New York. I probably would’ve been a lot for the long and recovering for my addiction and recovering from my PTSD had it not been for the administration bath that just completely screwed my head up and believing all sorts of false information. They sent me back so far by the way they discriminate me that it’s insane. It blows peoples minds when they hear I got called in the office and told I couldn’t wear a shirt because they could see if my bra underneath my shirt. ￼￼ ￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I don’t know how many more pictures of Ukraine I can take. The news constantly of what’s going on is pulling me over there. Every minute of every hour of every day I feel drawn more and more. I really wish I could just get up and leave and flying to Poland and crossover Ukraine. I have very fine line of what is right and what is wrong and when the line is crossed to wrong I will do whatever I can to at least help fight to balance it. Evil can only exist when good men and bad men trying to be good to something about it. Well I am not the best woman I’m not a terrible woman but I am a woman willing to try to fight for what’s right. and if that means giving up everything to fly over there and start a new and at least be part of the resistance that’s what I’m willing to do. There’s anyone reading this that has any connection to the international or a foreign defense unit and how to enlist without just all this BS red table going through the embassy please contact me. i’m a trained infantry man which is an 11 bravo and a truck driver 88 Mike I have other advanced training in the military that would be to good use even if it’s just cooking and driving and even basic medical I can do that. It’s a difficult choice because I would have to revert back to a more masculine presentation if I’m over there fighting. I won’t be able to maintain the level of femininity that I’m used to. But I’m willing to sacrifice that in order to fight for just cause. Dealing with triggers inpatient at tge VA. I’m having a very hard time with how certain policies are being used. I don’t want to be a hypocrite but there must be a line in the sand. Yiu can’t just claim you are a female and identity as one while still living as if you are a male. Using your white male privilege assuming others will adapt to you rather than try and conform to the group. I trying my hardest , but currently I’m severally triggered and I no longer feel safe. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I feel like I’m being a hypocrite but I also feel like I need to draw a line in my mind somewhere. A lot of my fellow female veterans are feeling very uncomfortable lately and I understand why. While gender may be subjective to what somebody says it is almost also take into consideration the trauma that female veterans have experience. Since I consider myself to have the privilege to be housed with the females I am very respectful. When I am not “Trish” and I remove my make up for the night or in the morning I completely cover from head to toe in my niqab . And many of the veterans have told me that they appreciate that. It’s very difficult to see people that go back-and-forth between presenting as a man yet saying they are  a woman. That is the case right now in the female unit and I feel like some white male privilege is being seen very clearly. In my mind white privilege is when white males are able to do certain things and they never even consider that may be highly offensive or they may be doing things that others don’t like.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Privileges is definitely being exerted. If you walk around not even considering how your looks may affect others and that you were hoping people just adapt to the most extreme interpretation of gender that is just being inconsiderate. So the VA in Bath New York they were super conservative and didn’t follow the rules at all, I feel bad this veteran would have had a horrible time and both considering I wasn’t female enough to be houses with the females int tk huh Jim I Bath New York. Here in Coatesville it’s to the opposite extreme where there is absolutely no boundary to many of the other female veterans it is exactly as if a male has just decided to say they’re female and then they get to come over here and put on a little bit of make up. Now I am not saying anything negative about the veteran they have every right to be who they are. I am saying is it they’re still caring their white male privilege and blatantly throwing it all the female faces. The way there’s no discretion or consideration for the trauma these females have suffered at the hands of mouths despite how the veteran may feel the inside out really look it’s just inappropriate for the female wing. I feel I’m caught in the middle on the one hand I wanted to send transgender rights for all the other hand I have many of the other female veterans upset and complaining saying they recognize that I am like a woman to them but they don’t want just anyone able to come and be amongst them. It again feels as if this is more of a case of non-binary that is being forced upon the females. It’s a very confusing and difficult time the more I see them I can understand the struggles they may be going through but on the other hand I just cannot understand the lack of consideration of the other veterans around them. It’s only a matter of time before we get a new version that just won’t take this or one of the other female veterans just has a meltdown leaves or just blows up.   The same way you wouldn’t wear a beer shirt or a shirt with marijuana‘s because it would be triggering is the same reason you wouldn’t want presents a completely malmascilan presents on the female wing. I have to net it has even become difficult than me and no longer going to the day room and watch TV because I feel watching TV with a man and I’m torn because I recognize the inside that that’s not who they are, but can they not see that I’m the outside that’s what they look like that’s what they’re put trying that’s how they talk that’s how their hands move everything is man man man and it’s very true for me very uncomfortable for me and I’ve been in constant High alert ever since then. Unfortunately my hypothesial is my PTSD that had calm down after the first week or two of being here is not right back to the levels of when I came in here I’m hoping that something changes all right able to get used to it I don’t know what. whatever feel is really going on is that the VA forces veterans that choose a gender between bound female. It’s not set up for the non-binary or those that just don’t identify are those that have completely transitioned in their mind on their body to what gender they are. I feel that if a veteran was the common that wasn’t completely out of the closet yet was just kind of testing the waters to see what would like to be female and they are actually truly non-binbinary and hasn’t completely committed. I feel that one should really have a concrete idea who they are and if they’re not sure which gender they are there should be a separate area in the VA front for non-binary veterans. And Vé just hasn’t caught up with us yet there is no good answer for non-binary, non-conforming, those are reject gender veterans. so it makes it very difficult on the veterans in the wings to be presented with somebody that doesn’t quite belong there an awesome exit difficult on the non-binary veteran to be placed into that situation. Which is exactly what everyone here feels is going on that they thought it would just be easier to force something on the females than on the males.  it’s a very frustrating . </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Oh wow I’m so far behind on posting. So much has changed here at the VA in the past few days. It has been very stressful. One of my very good friends that I made here whose name is very similar to my first wives is no longer here. It’s very unfortunate that they did not feel safe and there was a male veteran that was able to intimidate the female version to such a point that she had no choice but to leave the program.   I will miss her very much. We had a new veteran enter the female wing who identifies this transgender. To myself into many of the other female Veterans they look like a cis male.  This is cause a great deal of stress on the unit. As many of us feel that they brought male privilege with them in the way they don’t perceived issue a presenting in the mail form how that triggers many of the other females period for myself it just reminds me of a man of privilege don’t realize how their actions affect females have suffered trauma. Also I’m sure I’m biased cause I am also very jealous they would never ever be allowed to be a in a female wing in Bath New York I was not allowed to be in the female we in Bath New York for more than a day before I was removed again despite identifying his female looking completely like a female and going the whole 9 yards. Sean the administrator in Bath routinely violated my rights as a veteran on the property I was discriminated against over and over again. All you have to do is explain what gender you’re done if I win and you must be treated that way Sean never did that he found every way in the world to discriminate against me and not house me correctly which led to all sorts of problems that I’m still getting treated for PTSD because of how he treated me. For everyone sake on the unit we all hope that this other Veteran transitions more, just because the way they are presenting it is very triggering is causing problems and I need a females are now fighting amongst each other rather than confront the main issue again nothing negative against the fashion I’m sure they’re completely oblivious to what is going on. I will have to deal with my issues of being jealous, I just it throws in my face how terrible terrible terrible I was treated in Bath New York compared to what it looks like when the policy actually followed here in Cotsville. That’s New York really needs to be investigated it is just beyond believe how terrible they ignored policy there. I went six months identifying as a female in the male wing why was assaulted I got into fights and I was sexually assaulted raped pretty much. That’s not something I can easily get over I still blame administrator Sean for six months he left me there . It is triggered me so much I’ve become so depressed today just so upset just I feel like there’s no line to be drawn if it’s almost as a Bath is to us extreme one way in Coatesville is too extreme the other. I am having a very difficult time and I am feeling very uncomfortable in the way this other veteran presents them self. Again it is nothing against the person and the person I respect the person I like as a fellow veteran it is my issues and how I perceive a man I go to the extremes of covering my face with an a cop which is basically a Burka whenever I have my make up in my way off astronaut trigger the other females which they have said they are very appreciate of of for another veteran you just come and talk like a man walk like a man completely acts like a man but identify as a female to myself and the others it just doesn’t feel right. I don’t feel comfortable giving any additional information as I want to protect the anonymity of everybody here and have everyone has the right to recover without their business being known by the world, my business on other hand I am putting out there for Alton now so it’s a fine line that I need to draw of what I can say and what I can’t say I don’t think I’ve said too much. #transveterans #transcombatveterantranscombatveteran #beingtransisnotacrime #lgbtqvet #transrightsarehumanrights #LGBTQVeterans #LGBTQRightsAreHumanRights #transveteran#transg </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Oh wow 🤩 I looked so beautiful yesterday in this. It was a 3$ dress of Amazon that I spiced up to make work. Plus I used my little hat I made in crafts. If you are a larger person like my self 5’11 and 185 lbs (180 cm 84kg) here is a trick for cheap clothes. Type in key words like skirt or dress on Amazon. Then on the filters put lowest  to highest price and then select prime (eliminates cheap items with expensive shipping) . Shops that sell on Amazon will usually pick one size to down price to get a better ranking. Sometimes a super small item others a larger item. For example this brown dress was $29.99 but for XXL it was $3.98. This is how I got many items for very cheap. Each day check for new listings. Today I had a great day. I played dress up with a fellow veteran and we did a couple tik toks. Her and another vet then proceeded to clean my room and help organize it. I have a terrible time organizing with my memory issues from my brain injury. I almost cry most days my anxiety gets so bad most days when my room is messy.  i super appreciate what they did for me. I am ready starting to find a seance of belonging and  comradery . I am so lucky they are so accepting. They could not believe how ignorant some of the female veterans acted in Bath NY the amount of hateful transphobia they displayed in getting me removed from the female secured wing and returned to the room in the male wing I was pretty much raped in. Coatesville and Bath are night and day. The difference are wtafeeing. Last night I had terrible nightmares. I woke up three times in mid air before I came crashing down to the ground or furniture. One time I went flying into the nightstand and gouged my knee. It still hurts really bad. I can’t believe I woke up only to fall onto the ground. Is it terrible feeling to be awoken and terror only realize that you are in mid air and eminent pain is to follow. I don’t know exactly what keeping me up and causing me to be so stressed but something definitely is. Hopefully tonight I get a better rest but it’s already almost 1 AM. Thank you to all the kind veterans than help me and supported me and both bath and now here in Coatesville Pennsylvania at the VA. I truly appreciate how great my fellow Veterans convey. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> My prayers go out to the people of Ukraine today. I can’t imagine what they must be going through, may this be over quickly. Invasion of Ukraine has been so unsettling here at the Coatesville veterans hospital. Many veterans here are on edge overwhelmed with anxiety feeling like there’s a fight that they just can’t be a part of anymore. I can feel that anxiety I feel eminent doom. In another direction I’ve been feeling extremely beautiful lately. I really feel comfortable in my body, absolutely loving how I look on the outside and sometimes how I feel on the inside. It’s still quite a mind blowing experience to realize that a lot of my issues came from me being in the wrong body. I wish I could have those years back . All I can do now is make the best of the years I have left rather than look back on the years must look forward on the years ahead of me that I still have. I still have a lot of good years and at least I know who I am and can say I feel good about myself, something a lot of people can’t do. I need to remain positive and be happy for the time I have left. The time I have as the person I know I am and want to be, a strong beautiful transgender woman.  Being trans and a combat veteran make for a strange v  #transcombatveteran #beingtransisnotacrime #lgbtqvet #transrightsarehumanrights #LGBTQVeterans #LGBTQRightsAreHumanRights #ideservebetter #loveshouldnthurt #transgenderlivesmatter #transgenderlife #beingtrans #beingtranshurts #cleanandsober #onedayatatime #easydoesit #ideservehappiness #stopabuse #supportlgbtq #queer #queervet #coatsvillepa #coatesvilleva </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Well I’m not gonna lie today has been an extremely triggering day. Having to listen about the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has released all sorts of emotions. I can’t believe in the 21st-century nation states are still wreaking havoc with the destructive force of war. History is repeating itself the way Chamberlain and the rest of Europe tried to appease Hitler as he held them hostage with the threat of war, Putin is holding Europe in the west hostage once again but this time with Thermo nuclear holocaust. Make no mistake, it woukd be a  holocaust,  it would be to be the end of life as we know it. knowing that I’m a disabled veteran, soldier whose fought their last fight feels left out. If that was my homeland I would be absolutely devastated and I would grab a weapon and I would be fighting on the front lines. There’s something about war as horrible as it is that gives life its meaning. Everything is so bright and full of life, Until it isn’t. Then death sneaks up upon you like a wet blanket smothering out life and every form as it comes across it. Being in a veterans hospital so many other veterans of all different eras suffering from PTSD all on edge today. Reminding us of  the time in our life that every day seemed to have more meaning than all the rest of our life combined off the battlefield. again as much as I did test war never wanna feel the flames of that hell again like a moth attracted to fire I can’t help but be consumed by the high it gave me to know what any moment my life could be snuffed out in any moments the enemy‘s life could be snuffed out. Every sense is heightened every emotion is multiplied by a factor of 10, I’ve never lived life with such excitement as I did the year I was in Afghanistan. I feel part of PTSD is knowing that you will never be as powerful as you were never feel as good as you felt never taste life the way it tasted those days. From now to die every day just seems to get dollar unless important every day I wonder what’s the points why go on my best days are behind me is it gonna get any better or my just gonna slowly be bored till I die. Slowly slowly wither away until nothingness turning into the shadow of a man/woman I used to be. And why didn’t matter if I was a man or a woman all that matters is that I was a soldier and I did my job right. Life made sense, the world made sense. It’s of civilian world they can be so confusing instead of everything being so black and white there’s 1000 shades of gray.  If anyone knows of any volunteer opportunities to do anything ,drive truck , clean weapons,  cook,  even fight at the front lines. Again any volunteer opportunities that anyone knows of to go and support that Ukraine military I would love to know about any opportunity’s. Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 . </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Wow I’m finally starting to feel like I fit in here in Coatesville. I lost so much time in Bath New York being housed amongst the men. I had to waste so much time on just basic survival mode. Every time I would try and discuss any serious issue or bring up my trauma all the male veterans which is rolled her eyes and say not this bullshit again. No matter what I did or what I said it was never as good as what a fell a male that you’re not to say about the subject. Here in Coatesville I’m in the power program so I’m completely separated from the male population. I get to do a dual substance on PTSD program with only female veterans, which I get along with very well. Unfortunately over Presidents’ Day weekend there were some mil that that thought it was funny to make rape jokes. Someone asked them how they ever got any girls. The response was that they club them over the head until their unconscious and then take them and have their way with them. While watching a movie there was a female that died and another male here talked about how he would still “mount that”. Males here constantly are misogynistic. They don’t realize how triggering a lot things they say are to the my fellow veterans. Many of us are here for sexual trauma. What many of us have combat trauma as well it’s a sexual trauma that has broken us. When I signed up for the military and went into the army after the Marine Corps, it was a time of war I ain’t had no confusion about where I would be going. I knew I was off to Iraq or Afghanistan, I would be fighting in a war. There would be combat. People were gonna die.  when I join the Marine Corps I was not expecting sexual-assault to be involved. Having being raped while on the Marine Corps from my brief stent was the last thing that I ever thought was possible. I looked up to the marine values, everything that was good about America is what I saw and thought of an a Marine. My whole world paradigm was broken after the trauma suffered in the Marine Corps something I never fully recovered from. Here I am today over 25 years later still confused about my life which I can trace mostly back to my super brief time in the Marine Corps. Again these are two completely different experiences the PTSD that I suffer from Afghanistan it’s nothing compared to the trauma that I live with every day from the Marine Corps let alone the trauma on top of that that I live with every day being born the wrong body. That is the ultimate trauma. How do I describe that in terms of PTSD, I’m put in a PTSD program that just isn’t meant to deal with one acute problem but many many problems that have accumulated over the years and years. how am I supposed to get over all the years of being so confused so angry so sad so disappointed so jealous of other women wishing I was one too. How am I gonna get over all the years I lost with my kids that were stolen from me. All that anger is hard to undo I can’t get my children’s childhood back. Having that stolen from me from multiple children’s mothers it’s just something that’s unforgivable that I will never forgive them for they love to blame me and say I was there to say it was that, if it helps him sleep better at night . Who am I to judge. Other people love judge me without ever hearing the other side of the story. They’re always two sides to tell those unwilling to listen to both or just willfully ignorant and the situation.  I am so appreciative of all the help I am getting here and the support of my fellow Veterans especially my fellow female veterans that I’ve been excepting and very kind to me. The camaraderie that the other female versions of show me the support they’ve given me towards our shared traumas it’s something I’ve never had before I have always felt so alone in my battles against my drama for the first time there’s people there’s women that I understand they can relate that don’t make me feel so alone anymore. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Now that I am finally housed according to my gender identification I am actually starting to feel at ease. When I first arrived at Coatesville I was constantly on guard, scared, I was terrified. I have gotten used to being amongst the other female veterans. I feel camaraderie with them that I could just never feel amongst the other male veterans. The males will only open up to me about their sexuality if they were bisexual pansexual or homosexual. It always went a little bit like this hey I’m gonna tell you something it’s gonna make you so happy I’m gay or I’m bisexual and I am attracted to you. The problem was that they were usually much older than me a lot more overweight and not very nice to look at and when I told him I wasn’t interested in them they hated me. I then represented everybody in their life that rejected them. I do sometimes wonder where my sexuality would’ve gone had I not been violently raped at 17 making me completely hate men. Having repeated the same thing in Bath when I  was again sexually assaulted keeping me  disgusted by men for the most part. I am slowly coming to terms with a lot of my issues that I have had since I was a child. Being forced to lie constantly about who I was has led me to lie easily in adult life. Some thing that my therapist said is completely natural. When a child is forced lie about absolutely everything in their life concerning who they are how they supposed to know what the truth really means, what value can you play some truth when it’s detrimental to you as a child. I am still extremely confused about everything. But the more I get used to my body, see my face in the mirror, the more I know I was always meant to be a woman. I feel so happy just frolicking some music dancing and skipping. The way my voice is changed the way I talk the way I now see the world is like a third completely different eyes. I can’t explain the happiness and joy that comes from dressing and making my face up in according to affirm my gender. I absolutely love who I am. I can’t believe how happy I am and who I am. I still have a Lotta issues a lot of trauma lotta shit bothers me but it doesn’t bother me to the extreme like it bothered me when I was Patrick. Trash is a beautiful strong woman they can handle the bullshit in life, wants to get high but knows she can’t meet any of her goals if she’s addicted to drugs. I’m sorry do you notice how much biases I have in the world whether it’s a halo bias whether it’s just for reasons I don’t know. So much of how I interact with the world is for reasons I don’t completely understand. I wonder how many choices I made with that underlying bias of who I truly am that guided me in the direction of where I am today.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s almost been a month since I got to this PTSD program in Coatesville Pennsylvania. I can’t believe how quick time flies when I’m actually getting the help I need. Today was the first time I have gotten really upset an a long time. They tried having games for the veterans but it involves motor skills. Due to my TBI and nerve damage it is very difficult for me to engage in these types of activities. When I was unable to stand still balance thing or do other coordinated games people laughed at me and mocked me not realizing that I wasn’t pretending I really could not do those things. People see a beautiful confident woman and just assume that I have nothing wrong with me. They can’t see the scars in both the inside and the scars underneath my make up from my injury in Afghanistan. It reminds me that as much as I sometimes feel like I have recovered from my injuries I still have a lot of things I will never be able to do again. I don’t understand why in a hospital full of other disabled veterans that they would have these types of games competing us against each other when our some of the veterans here just are hurt so bad they can’t do those types of things. The few veterans that have absolutely no issues with them of course won every single game and it just reminded the rest of us veterans that have disabilities that we can’t participate in those types of games without looking like a fool. I got so upset at some of the games. The one where we had to take what they called chopsticks but we’re really just a little thin sticks. And pick up her shoes by the paper and put them in a cup. I thought I will do really well this I eat with chopsticks all the time back home in Vietnam. But they weren’t even chopsticks and in order to pick up the paper you need to be able to stop your hands from shaking for a second. Oh well I tried the best of my ability to have fun but I ended up just getting angrier and angrier until I almost blew up and had to walk out of there. I forgot just how much I have to work on my anger when it comes to my disabilities. Add being transgender 🏳️‍⚧️ in a veterans hospital and it gets difficult. #transveteran #lgbtqveteran #queerveteran #ptsd  (at Coatesville VA Medical Center) https://www.instagram.com/p/CaGK0CRMvdF/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>

				<p class="card-body"> This is one of my favorite outfits. I did not do my makeup as well as I usually get it with this outfit though. I was watching the show “botched” . I saw some beautiful trans woman. They transitioned at 13 and 16. I can’t even imagine having support like that. I got hit with being told I looked “gay” as a child by my mother when I tried to wear certain things I thought was cute. I had no idea what that meant. All I knew was that in elementary school “gay” was negative. You got called gay or Gaylord as just part of the daily slurs children would use to be mean. Basically my whole life I was sent the message that gay or trans was something terrible, evil even. Family had no real idea how I felt about myself, not that there were not tons of signs. I would be brought to churches all over the place as a child and sometimes there woukd be other kids. (I was being brought to my mothers AA meetings) . I would wear long shirts and pretend they were a dress and tell other kids I was a girl. I was made to feel like I was doing something so terrible. In elementary school all my friends were girls. I never had an friends that were guys. In Highschool i ended up </p>
<p class="card-body"> Having girlfriends romantically tgst shoukd have just been really good friends. It’s was all so super confusing. Based on all the messages I got growing up that transgender people were evil and going to hell scared me on the inside when I believed in such fairy tales. I never once thought being a girl was an option I had. People always blamed the fact that my parents got divorced on my my discipline issues in school or my drinking as a teenager, when in reality it was because I was constantly confused and super angry about being a guy. I mean my mom did nothing but bash men and who terrible they were. I just plain didn’t like being a boy. I absolutely hated sports. My mom loved them so I got forced in to that. Back to watch”botched”, it was the first time I could actually picture my self with a chest and bottom surgery. I would never even contemplate that extreme prior to yesterday. Everyone month i become more and more confident in who I am, so it hurts so much when people I live compare me to something negative hurts so much. I hate hearing that people think they need therapy to deal with someone being trans??? Do you need therapy to not be racist? Maybe they do. But being anti LGBTQ and bring racist are tied together in ignorance. Education is the answer to both not therapy .  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had no problem wearing an outfit that absolutely blew the minds of the people at the Bath VA. I was body shamed and blamed for how men thought. I have a slip on under a tattoo body suit then a bra and shirt. In Bath i would be told people thought it was a crop top . I was Like and??? So??? It was like sn Islamic republic in Bath were I had to dress a certain way because the men had “confusing thoughts” what ever that means. So I basically need to enjoy my time in Coatesville. I’m pro unit going to be somewhere so supportive and accepting for a long time. I have anxiety about going home . I have to remember that not everyone is accepting. That done places have a lot of uneducated people that still believe homosexuality is a disease or caused by demons. Yeah that’s the backwards mentality I have to remember exists back home. Well hopefully overtime as the educated younger generation replaces the older ignorant generation things will change. Just growing up with the internet and access to the world helps the new generation. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Another peaceful weekend inpatient. I hope to start of tomorrow full speed. I’m so happy when I just look at myself and go about my life as Trish, but I’m so scared of what life will mean afterwards. I know I look different . I’m not the exact same person anymore. I’m actually happy. I don’t feel so lost wondering why I feel so off. It’s something that causes me so much pain. I don’t understand how anyone could be against another human being finding them self. Why do some people hide behind religion and say it’s wrong? Are you God? I’m pretty sure if you are Christian, it’s something Jesus never talked about negatively. He said love your neighbor. Not love your neighbor unless they are LGBTQ. And if you say God doesn’t make mistakes and put me in the right body. Well by that logic why does God give babies cancer and kill them before they can grow up. If God doesn’t make mistakes that’s a pretty sick God. Perhaps as a deist I can agree there is a God, but besides starting the universe they have no role in the day to day. We are on our own. God doesn’t play favorites and answer some prayers but ignore others. Or choose sides between the Christian, Hindu or Muslim. All are equal if they are a good person. But those that warp religion are evil. The Taliban that is absolutely destroying Afghanistan is evil. The work of the preverbal devil. Watching Afghanistan fall this year has been so devastating. A gut punch. I was listening to NPR about all the Afghans in the LGBTQ community that mud go into hiding if they could not flee their country. In free of having their head cut off or another way of being killed. It’s sad that that sort of extreme hate exists in the world. Those that hate or judge me for who I am think along the same line as the backwards cavemen of the Taliban. You may not be so extreme, but still on the side of ignorance. I’m so disappointed to hear certain backwards states like Florida try and ban any mention of being gay in schools. What do some idiots in power think? Repressing children will do what?? Lead to productive citizens or broken people? So much hate in this world. Either you are against hate and speak out against it or you support hate and are silent. By being silent about injustice you are as guilty as those that hate and spread it. Only when everyone looks out for their fellow human regardless of who they pray to, what color they are, who they love ir how they identify will we all be safe to be who we are. To ignore the plight of others leaves us vulnerable to be targeted someday with no hope of someone else coming to aid us since we remained silent for them. Love and peace to all. 😘 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I have 6 month sobriety today. I have been clean and sober for 1/2 a year. But it’s not much of a milestone. I have been inpatient at VA hospitals. It’s just dry days. If I was offered drugs on the outside I would still most definitely take them Hoping this time it would be different and I could control them, or not really care if it slowly killed me. That’s actually closer to the truth, I don’t really care anymore if I die an addict. At least if have purpose. Every time I build a little self esteem as Trish, start to have faith in my self, feel beautiful and proud of myself it all gets torn down by certain people in my life that treat who I am with disgust. I’m treated like I’m a burden. That being transgender is an embarrassment to them . I have given so much to some people, sacrificed so much, been so forgiving. Then I am just a human born to a body that I don’t match and I am a problem, something that caused stress and problems for others. That just hurts. When people you thought would love you and stand by you through anything , treat you as a burden rather than be proud to know someone so strong to be who they are, hurts. So many times in life I was suicidal and did not understand why. I know why. It hurts so much to be forced into a gender role to be taken seriously and treated with dignity. To be loved . I feel so absolutely alone, that I will never find love. A real person not concerned about what other people think. I can’t believe I gave up on a truly strong person. They never cared about what others thought . I’m so disappointed in people sometimes . Most Everyone knows what is right and what is wrong but go along with the majority regardless of what way the wind blows the mob mentality. I hate being seen as just “trans” . That only describes my gender, not who I am. I am so much more than my gender. I pray I find someone someday as  that sees that. And I will keep my friends that see me that way close. I’m really trying . All I wanted was to get home and continue with life. I still have a spark of life left in me and hopefully it will burn Hốt enough to jumpstart my life in a positive way again. The world is still very big and a lot of places I have not been. I’m looking forward to exploring my future. I will overcome the hate and negativity of those that try and bring me down by always walking all over me and putting me down . I need to remember to never allow my self to be put down and put second. The more I think about how much I was willing to hurt my self for others the more I’m disgusted. Anyone that would hide me, ask me to not be myself or say I would embarrass them is not a good person for me and just not a good person. I have enough self esteem left to realize I deserve better than to routinely be insulted like that. I pray for a better tomorrow. Peace and love 💕.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Day 6 Coatesville PA VHA </p>
<p class="card-body"> OMG!!! I was so sick yesterday! I felt like I was just going to die. Withdrawal does not feel that bad. My head hurt, my bones hurt, the whole world went in circles and I was completely out of it. I’m glad I had no appetite. I was sent food sure to make me sick if I had an upset stomach. The food is great if I go in person, but I could not eat almost any of the items they sent me. I am so glad for that to be over. Well this place is a lot more confining than Bath, but it’s winter and I don’t smoke so I don’t need to go out side. Unlike the Bath VA, Coatesville actually enforces the ”no smoking” policy of the VA. I am in two programs. I am in POWER, a rehab program for woman, and a mixed PTSD program. So far the classes have been very helpful. I am housed with tge woman that I identify with and it has been great. I have not had much interactions with the male veterans and I am completely fine with that. I’m not really interested in much they are. I don’t care for sports on the least, and I swear that is what makes their world go round.  I need to dramatically cut down on my belongings to fly home, but I don’t know how to start. Going home is going to be really hard. I don’t have any real support. I have people that tell me I need to look at it from their point. Or people that say  I should be happy they don’t listen to stupid ignorant people. It would be like you had cancer and I said “ you having cancer is going to be really hard on me, are you sure you have to cure your cancer. If you could just die I would prefer that because the cure is really embarrassing “. I know people that have been burned terribly or lost limbs must have gone through this with family. Always pick someone for there personality not there looks. But if they end up with a bad personality you are stuck with nothing so that’s not good either. I keep finding that people I thought to ge educated and progressive actually just speak it. It okay with the. Ad long as you are not around them. People I thought where friends, not great friends but still friends turns out they talk behind my back and reinforce transphobic agendas. I’m amazed at how many people completely ignore the privacy rules of AA/NA. If you see me at a meeting you don’t get to go tell other people how I look or what I say! I’m so disappointed in ever doing 12 step programs. In both Bath NY and Hanoi Vietnam people have broken confidentiality. I’m finding the world is not the educated tolerant world I thought, but a backward, ignorant and hateful world. Now I’m paranoid that everyone in Coatesville may secretly hate me and just pretend to nice and tolerant. I understand why the younger generation is so angry and demanding change.

				<p class="card-body"> I made s’mores yesterday at rec therapy. I am so happy with how things are going at the Coatesville PA VHA. I wonder if the people that caused be such misery have any idea just what type of hell I went through because of some small selfish issue they had. It’s a new year and a new program. Im so exited and happy to finally have support . #bathnyvha #coatesvillepavha   (at Coatesville VA Medical Center) https://www.instagram.com/p/CZdk5uHMT__/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Getting ready for the lunar new year 🧧 (Têt) . So far Coatesville VHA has been so good for me. I am in the PTSD program and the woman’s Power program for substance abuse. In bath NY tge female wing all had there own bathroom for each room. Here In Coatesville I am in tbr female wing and we share a Bathroom and shower. There is no issue here so I really don’t understand why administrators have so much power to the transphobic haters that caused issues. Here in Coatesville the law is the law, and policy is policy. Something that Bath VHA could really learn from. It sounds like admin is well educated in the needs of there population here. I’m so excited to finally get the help I need.

				<p class="card-body"> Day 2/4 @ Coatesville PA VHA  I was so happy to sevtjus flag on on third day here. They really do take LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 issues seriously. I already had to deal with admin here. They got worried some female veterans coming into the program may take issue with me sharing a bathroom and using the same shower. I would have been taking it away from a veteran that has had it. I do not want any special treatment unless absolutely necessary. So far the other female veterans have been very accepting. It is the weekend and things have slowed down. I am busy getting things unpacked. We played Bingo and won $10. The negative is I’m binge eating, not sleeping well and having false memories. It’s crazy at times in my head. I’m really looking forward to this program. Everyone seems to be really nice. I’m happy to be out of Bath and be here. I just wish there was a way to make Bath NY VHA comply with federal policy the way they do hear. #transpride #transisbeautiful #translivesmatter #lgbtq #lgbt #transveteran #veteranslivesmatter #stopthe22 #mtf #transandproud #bathnyvha #coatesvillepaVHA #veteransaffairs #lgbtqia #queer #queerveteran #LGBTQVeterans #vafingerlakes #PTSDRecovery #suds #rehab #varehab #mstsurvivor #survivor #transrightsarehumanrights #transrights (at Coatesville VA Medical Center) https://www.instagram.com/p/CZV1GxWMIVx/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Day 01 Coatesville PA VHA (PTSD/SUD program)  So today was my first full day in Coatesville. Talk about night and day from the Bath VA. So far the other females have not been ignorant. They are fine with me here . They seem to grasp the difference between sex and gender. My sex is male at birth . My gender is female. All the staff here have been extremely validating. They have supported me in so much. Things that took weeks or months or never happened at Bath happened immediately. I had waiting 5 months for the correct tegretol medication and it never got fixed at Bath. It was fixed here. I complained that people kept using the verbarg “technical you are a man”. Administration in Bath had no issue with people talking one that. So admin furthered transphobia in Bath NY. Here they understood how hurtful it is to ge referenced in that way. They immediately got me the paperwork to change my gender here at the VA. I really can’t be mad at admin for making me come here over Wyoming. So far I think I will get help here. They are letting me do substance abuse after understanding how little rehab I actually had. I am still having. Bit of a hard time with done veterans that keep referring to me as “really a dude”. They add very nice so I’m trying Gently explain how they are wrong in the way they think. I will hopefully finally get to deal with all my unresolved trauma and issues of having to live with in the reality that others constroctrx for me.  I am truly coming to terms with who I am. Why is it always those we lean on for support are the ones that are so negative about me. I miss home so much !!!   #transpride #transisbeautiful #translivesmatter #lgbtq #lgbt #transveteran #veteranslivesmatter #stopthe22 #mtf #transandproud #bathnyvha #coatesvillepaVHA #veteransaffairs #lgbtqia #queer #queerveteran #LGBTQVeterans #vafingerlakes #PTSDRecovery #suds #rehab #varehab #mstsurvivor #survivor #transrightsarehumanrights #transrights  https://www.instagram.com/p/CZQcCYSsTdf/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Good bye Bath VHA! Over all it was a wonderful experience. Don’t get me wrong I did not hate the place. Was i harassed, discriminated , and yes even criminally sexually assaulted , ? Yes! But being able to stand up to the Sean and Brian’s of the world when  it comes to dealing with a white male centric system I was able to not only survive, but thrive. If you are on a cruise that is awesome, great food and the best people but the captain throws you overboard and you are surrounded by sharks, do you talk about how great the ship was or do you direct your attention to not being eaten by the sharks. That’s how I felt my stay at the Bath VA was. I was constantly told to have patience about having any rehab classes, or adres if my medical and dental concerns, so in the end I was discharged with out really having any rehab besides dry days. I’m still is constant physical pain from my injuries in Afghanistan. I never got to see physical therapy. My teeth are killing me. I was told I am 100% so I could get my teeth fixed later. They don’t under stand it will get a year. I will loose my teeth. The Main Administrator Sean to thus day probably does not recognize how he treated me. From </p>
<p class="card-body"> Dismissing my opinion that showing a convoy blow up in an IED attack was not the best image for a stand down. Especially if maybe sind people got severely burned and lust friends in an ambush. Or being told Make veterans could not control them selves sexually so I could not wear gloves to promote AIDES research or other clothing that represented my Culture. There was not one standard set of rules. They had rules for me and other LGBTQ veterans and then rules for minorities, then rules for the white make veterans. Not all minorities Where discriminated against but a lot told me they were. I consider myself a minority. For example make veterans can watch football in any wing they want . Freely watch movies in other peoples rooms all weekend. Nothing is almost ever said. I have a friend, lust a friend that is also LGBTQ. Once the admin discovered my friend was LGBTQ they separated us and he was no longer able to help me preform tasks o can’t due to my disability. They would not let him come help me pack, they decided this all last minute making things very difficult. It sucks that ldoe in administration are not educated in the law or federal policy. You will have to buy my book about transitioning at the VA so hear all the constant bull shit a very small number of people did. I am still so disappointed I was told I must go to PA or get no help. In Retaliation I could not go to my Wyoming program. I was told by the Sheridan VA I could start on the 28th of this month. Two days later. People are trying to make it sound like I would have been waiting a month. False! And even if it was true why send me to a program that the worst case scenario in my head is I hang my self in frustration. I was lied to by every one. I was promised I would know something about the program I’m going to, where I will be housed, who I will be with. No one at Bath helped me and no one from Coatesvilke PA called me. I left multiple messages with tge LGBTQ coordinator there. All though the LGBTQ coordinator here was unable to help much. Sean found a way to ignore policy and what he was told by doing an ethics review and kicking me out rather than desk with the fact I was housed wrong, and I was constantly harassed and felt unsafe because of it. Hell I never would have been assaulted had i been protected by being housed correctly. Do anyway I am now on the road to Costesville. I am terrified. I miss home , it’s lunar new year and I will be completely alone over my holidays. Other veterans that celebrate Judeo-Christian holidays got to stay with people they knew over the holiday, a courtesy not extended to me for my culture I am part of (Vietnamese Têt) . I will miss all the good people of Bath. I am much stronger due to all the adversity and at times cruel treatment. Peace and love to all !!! </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s getting closer and closer to going Home to Hanoi! I can’t wait to get Home. Currently I’m dealing with one of the harder types of discrimination. Where people don’t directly do anything I hurt you, but they don’t do anything to help you. I got a speech from the administrated about how I should be so thankful my team worked on getting me into a ptsd program. That they geht over backwards. One : you won’t let me go to the program they got me into and are forcing me to go to the one program I always stated I did not want at all costs. Second I call it doing there job, third it’s not my fault so many places denied me because I’m a trans veteran . But my first point of it was pointless off all the work because I not going there. And I don’t think people listened. My fist choice was return to Hanoi, my second was go to Portland Oregon, third was an inpatient PTSD. I see other people are going to Portland, my Home of record. People are going to west coast ptsd programs. Why us the administration here being so petty in retaliation and punishing me with Pennsylvania??? They still have not got back to me on if they will follow federal law and policy and move me or continue to house me against policy. And that people is why I am being kicked out of the Bath VA. Other veterans can stay longer to finish their dental. I can not finish dental and am on terrible pain. I have been denied seeing s multitude of providers that I have begged to see. It’s not that tge VA system doesn’t work. I see it work for others. It has worked for me on the west coast. It’s that these are some people on some positions they have no business being in and are not qualified and undereducated. But they could be worse, they are giving me breathing room so I can pack. And I’m grieving from the ones I lost last year. My pull to use is still very very strong. I’m more confusedthsn when I got here, and I am far more depressed. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am so absolutely disgusted in the absolute disregard and discrimination I have been shown at the Bath VA. I have been lied to at every corner. Some staff just waited for the right moment to lie and sabotage me. One person that is supposed to help me with school and/or work has been absolutely worthless. Every month I woukd get asked the same questions and never once did they do anything . While COVID had hit the VA here I also had lost someone very close to me.  I was scheduled for a meeting in another building at the peak of COVID risk, classes had been cut in half and only 20 minutes Long. I really needed my 10 am group as I had no other groups that day to help me with the extreme despair I was feeling. I asked my social worker, she said it was okay if I called him. I had the front desk send him a message and I called him before I woukd have had the appointment. He gave me all sorts of attitude and still had not done anything about what I ask him each month. I wrote up my second complaint on him that was supposed to be anonymous. In stead when it came time to see if I could go to the program of my choice to deal with pretty much being raped at the VA here , I was told no! I could not have the extra 2 days to go there. The person I had reported for being useless lied about me, said I was a no show twice. I’m sure they found out I had complained about there attitude aground me and that’s why they completely lied. I had hanged up on by two men across from me just slamming me with bull shit. They could not keep there voice at a neutral level and acted like we where back in the marine corps, making me just lock up in absolute terror. When a msn yells to me that they are in charge and I will do what the say now mater what and I have no choice but to obey them, I feel they are just on a power trip. People do t understand that a person can be a good person up to the point they are no. The person that heads administration here has been fair to cis veterans. But he is an absolutely different person around me. He had me confined to my room over a false accusation. He said he had to stick to what he said because he does not change his mind. I was tortured in absolute hell for 48 hours. That event directly led to my assault. Had I never been punished with out reason, the staff member never would have had access to do what they did. So people can seem nice and decent until they are not. Would you go up to a person a different ethnicity or color than you and tell them “it’s okay you are a different color, I don’t think you are my equal but I will pretend you are”. I feel I was told that over and over when I was told people do not agree with my life choices being transgender. I hate they slip in insults in a way that protects them. First it’s not a life choice and second you hold a federal government position, why are you telling me your personal feelings about parts of tge LGBTQ community? Keep your personal thoughts to your self. Treat me with dignity and equality under the law and we will be fine. I really hate some that feels they have an important job but when ever something goes wrong they take absolutely no responsibility. This is the same person that thought It would be appropriate to show a convoy being blown up at a safety stand down as the welcome page. There is absolutely nothing funny about a picture like that. Just because on that day in his picture no US military were harmed , many tones US military and civilians where harmed or killed. I list close friends in what looked just like that picture. I suffer burn scars from the flames of a situation that looked like that picture. I could feel my whole body burning when I saw that. I asked if it could be removed that it was not appropriate for an anti suicide and safety brief. I was ignored. As i feel I have been many times. I will the. Be told of all the rings they have done to be accommodating. If you have to bend over backwards to become 1/2 compliant with federal VHA policy, that’s on you and not you helping me. Basically I helped you realize how far out of compliance  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Well it’s sad to say transphobia and discrimination is alive and well. Some men feel the need to show their power and humiliate others for asking to get treated fairly and equally. That was just too much to ask for at the Bath NY DOM. I have been working very hard to get into a program in Wyoming. I could get in probably on the 28th of January. As program in Pennsylvania that is not a good fit for me, and have begged not to go to I am being forced to go there or live on the street. No compromise. I had reached out to the patient advocate to see if I could get a 48 hour extension to attend the the other program. The Administrator here did mit like that. At my meeting today I was told how little he respected me and that I was basically shit in his eyes. The first sentence was that I must go to Pennsylvania no matter what happens at the meeting and no compromise. I had no representation. My social worker was out and they never replaced my addiction therapist. The Vic rehab ass that is totally incompetent through me under the bus, I feel he constantly messes with me, I asked many times not to schedule me at 10 am. For 3 months I have asked him to look I to my GI Nil bring reduced. Every time I see him it’s the same thing and he has done absolutely nothing. So I called him instead. He lied about how I contacted him, he had harassed me many times so what’s new. The Administration has lied to me and let me down numerous times. Not allowing me 2 days to go to a program I need while ge has let people stay a week waiting for something they ordered on Amazon shows the discrimination. As soon as I asked someone over the administrations head to please house me according to law and policy because I don’t feel safe in the area I was sexually assaulted and basically raped, I was retaliated against by being forced to go to a program I don’t want to go to. It is so hard dealing with constant humiliation of certain staff members using words that are clearly harassment and discrimination. It’s no wonder so many in the lgbtq community end up taking their life. When asking for equality is asking to much at a federal institution , it feels hopeless. I was promised I would have my service connected teeth fixed tgst are causing me great pain. That I would see s neurologist, that I could start getting screened for HRT, that I would have my knee braces and see physical therapy, that I would get a program or housing on the west coast.No! Not for me. For almost any other veteran but the hate and discuss i can feel done have towards me is being shown in how I’m being punished by not being allowed to go to the program I want. I have received very little rehab, I have brought that to the attention of people in charge and they just lie and say I did not. At least this time I have clear proof of what was said. Some peoples ego and power trips are not appropriate. There has now been s very clear and documented case of discrimination that has occurred. It happens, it’s not right but dinosaurs like the ignorant people I deal with still exist. And it hurts when good people sit quit and do nothing. I feel I was sandbagged. Total bull shit and lies where what I heard. Hate out of a homophobic, transphobic egomaniac is what I was spewed with.  Overall my experience has been a positive one here at the Bath NY VHA. It’s only a few select people that have to much power and are able to make things difficult for me I take issue with. But the agency I am working with told me this woukd probably be the case. It’s a shame people can’t see the grave they have dug for themselves metaphorically by the concrete actions of routine discrimination they have either done the self or allowed to happen. If you have a female assaulted in an unsecured area and you don’t move her the appropriate secure wing you are culpable under civil litigation. As simple as that. I’m looking forward to the lunar new year (Têt) on February 1st. My culturally valued Where also totally dismissed when I asked for my beliefs to be respected on how taboo it is to switch programs on the cusp of the new  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Things are not going well at all. The VA has let me down time and again. Why do I keep trusting them. I started rehab in August. I was supposed to fly home to Vietnam in October. About a week before I was to fly home I attempted suicide after being sexually assaulted by a VA staff member and not getting and trauma counseling. I then was told not to fly home knowing if I didn’t I might not be able to go home for a while. I then restarted Rehab. I did the Echo phase all over again in October and November . I then thought I had until mid February or March to complete rehab. I also assumed after I was assaulted in the male wing I would be moved to the secure female wing. I was wrong. Dispute waiting patiently if never happened. When I pressed the issue last week I feel administration retaliated against me. Telling me I had to dress like a straight person. Of course that’s not what was literally said but I was told I could not wear certain materials or colors . I could not wear gloves or fishnets. I could not wear hats that staff wear the same kind. Now it seems there solution is to force me into an all male PTSD program that may sometimes have a female, but is strongly geared towards the male veteran community. So I have had a terrible time at the Bath NY VHA and their solution to me being depressed, suicidal at times, and wanting to use narcotics now more than when I got here is to just force me out ASAP. I need rehab. I have not received rehab. When at the basic human level I am not respected by the administration, how can I expect other veterans to respect me. I constantly question my self, my sanity and my mental health. What is the administrations response? To throw in my face that I am not good enough. Other transgender females have been housed appropriately . I must be doing something wrong because I am just a crazy man in woman’s cloths. They do not truly few me as anything else or I would be treated with that most basic of human dignity. The prior transgender females got housed appropriately but I will not be. I am expected to recover in this hostile environment. An environment i have yet to see physical therapy, my dental work has badly began. I have not been able to see anyone about HRT. Am I supposed to start all this over again? I am very frustrated and depressed for how I am being treated. This is why I don’t trust the VA. 😢 😭 #lgbtqia #transveteran #lgbtqveteran #lgbtqrights #transgender #transgenderrights #lgbtveteran #lgbtqveteran #veteran #va #bathnyva #discrimination #StopThe22 </p>

I am expected to recover in this hostile environment. An environment i have yet to see physical therapy, my dental work has badly began. I have not been able to see anyone about HRT. Am I supposed to start all this over again? I am very frustrated and depressed for how I am being treated. This is why I don’t trust the VA. 😢 😭 #lgbtqia #transveteran #lgbtqveteran #lgbtqrights #transgender #transgenderrights #lgbtveteran #lgbtqveteran #veteran #va #bathnyva #discrimination #StopThe22 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Who am I? What am I? Am I crazy indulging in a fantasy? Am I seen by some as just a crazy man in a dress?? Words like that destroy me. I have had gender dysphoria of my body since s  </p>
<p class="card-body"> a child. I have never wanted to be a boy, I pretend to was a girl through my childhood, I see a beautiful woman in the mirror. I see the disgusting parts of something else when I shower. I have a hate for parts of my body. I want to die or chop things off done days. I’m judged so harshly I feel just for one thing on me. If I could choose my gender like some claim, why the hell would I want such grief? What a crazy week. After three months of fighting to be placed according to my gender I had success and failure. It started with Monday telling me I would be moving into a smaller room and in the male wing and I would loose my ability to walk! I have had issues walking since I was injured in Afghanistan in 2010. It took a lot if therapy and hard work to walk and talk close to normal again. But over the years the injury caught up with me in intolerable pain. I used narcotics for the pain. Then in detox I constantly danced to stretch my body. I am extremely sensitive to cold, thus living I. Hawaii or SE Asia so as it got cold, walking outside was out. I’m not cleared for the gym so that’s out. Luckily when I was in detox I requested therapy and I ended up getting recommended for s room with a bath tub. I thought I was housed in the male wing because I could get a tub. I soak morning, afternoon, and night for an hour each time. This maintains my ability to walk. Moving to another room on the male wing with no tub was adding insult to injury. Then I was forced to excel my request to housed in the gender appropriate wing. The Patient advocate contacted regional administration that indeed explained that I was being housed against VHA policy and belonged in the female wing. Staff here did not understand sex and gender are not the same . Having a penis or vagina dictate your sex but not your gender. You may have a vagina and be male. You may have a penis and be female. You may not identify either way. It’s. It and dry under policy. In the past 4 years there have been multiple transgender veterans. They have all been placed according to there gender. I am the first female transgender veteran with a certain person in charge. I feel they have very little education on LGBTQIA. And not much interests in learning. After I went over their head, I was reprimanded in other ways. I was told queer was not a culture. I could not wear anything lace or fishnets. I could not wear my gloves. An iconic part of queer culture. I feel so disrespected to be told my culture means so little to Administration tgst they acknowledge it exists. Males look under tables to stair between my skirt. Again I was told I should not wear a skirt. Men can wear shorts above the knee, but I must wear a skirt below my knees. Blatant discrimination. I have the exact same clothing as staff that I cant wear. I am just in shock at how absolutely disrespectful administration was in allowing veterans that literally complain about anything. I was asked why I don’t wear pants or dress like the other female veterans. So my culture is inappropriate but others culture is superior to mine. I got that message very clear. According to federal policy I may not dress obscene, but inappropriate is not a word to  be used. It is subjective. Words like appropriate have caused issues for many culture that are not mainstream white people. The African American population has their hair and styles attacked. In the work Place ethnic minorities wearing what is normal in thier culture was deemed inappropriate. Today the VHA respects ethnic and culture. So to be told queer has no culture is highly offensive. I wear a quer style of “queer goth, queer punk, and queer Lolita” all thre May  be googled and see it is mainstream in parts of the USA. I am conservative in how I dress compared to how I would in the “woke west” is. Why was what I wear perfectly acceptable 5 years ago. Once upon a time woman could not wear pants. It was obscene. In Saudi Arabia woman must be completely covered because men can’t control themselves. The Administration is making the Same argument that I am asking for troubl </p>

				<p class="card-body"> 🥺😢😭😭😭🤯 I was so so very happy today, only to have that happiness ripped away and turned in to hours of crying and despair. Rather than be supported by my peers, some turned on me and decided to cause me misery . In life happy pyspread happiness and unhappy people spread unhappiness.  I should not be surprised, the same people tgst will use ethnic slurs, derogatory words for being gay would also of course be transphobic.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> After months of trying to get VA directive 1341 (2) to be enforced I finally had a meeting with local and regional administration. It was made clear that for medical purposes my sex at birth is male, my gender is female. As per Federal guidelines i am a transgender female veteran entitled to woman’s services and to be housed in the appropriate wing, the female wing. They told me I had o my a few hours to move everything. I was so happy, I gad finally gotten one step closer to equality. My status in society was final validated. The law and policy was finally on my size. But just like in past civil Liberty struggles when equality was on the plate, there will be those that are ignorant and narrow minded that bring up situations that have no bearing on the current situations. When they integrated the forces there where white people that refused to be housed with people of color saying they did not belong, they were less then. Same as today when an organ that is on my body makes people judge who I am. Once it was socially acceptable to look at woman or people of color as inferior to white men and people where judged by the color of their skin or told they were inferior for their gender. Today I am being judged for my sex at birth. I am being unfairly discriminated against for someone’s backwards, outdated, ignorant gender bios. Parts of society did not like the desegregation of society, the same way some people today still few gender as an anatomical difference. Look up the definition of gender.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> gen·der </p>
<p class="card-body"> /ˈjendər/ </p>
<p class="card-body">  Learn to pronounce </p>
<p class="card-body"> noun </p>
<p class="card-body"> either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female. </p>
<p class="card-body"> It cleary states that my biology and anatomy have no bearing on my gender if I identify if live by a certain gender. I’m all fairness a female that talks, dresses and acts like a male is more male than I am. I would make an argument that in many aspects I am more female than certain people that are female for their sex at birth. I have to remember that this East coast mentality of the under educated  is a dying mentality. But only by standing my ground now and demanding the laws and guidelines set in place are enforced will I make the path easier on the transgender veterans that come after me. Autherine Lucy was hated by many when she demanded her place at the university of Alabama. How backwards it seems today for the arguments people had against her . She had the law on her side. But only be demanding that law to be enforced did we reach this point in society today. Had she not fought for her rights then because it was hard or people were uncomfortable, history may have taken longer. Same today, because those that still have an antiquated way of thinking and viewing gender are uncomfortable is no reason for me to compromise my beliefs or give up on equality and what is right. Being judged for having a penis is just as wrong as being judged for ones religion, sexual orientation, or the color of ones skin. But the other alternative I have been told by a few is that if jealousy for being the best looking female veteran here hands down. It did cheer me up to have do many male veterans tell me that I am beautiful and the best dressed and most attractive female. Oh well the war isn’t over, just a temporary retreat of this one battle. Nothing has been decided. Just put on hold until tomorrow. I hope and pray federal policy is upheld over the unjust discrimination and hate. Some have made the argument that gender identity and skin color can not be compared. It’s true they are very different with different issues. At least if I was discriminated against I would have friends and family of the same ethnicity so I would not feel so alone. Unfortunately I don’t have the luxury of having anyone in my family that is trans. I lost many friends when  I came out. So I fight alone many times and wish I had more people on my side. It hurts when selfish people pretend they are nice when in fact they are two faced miserable back stabbers. Some people need to have something to complain about and are only happy when they hurt others and make them cry. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> So welcome to 2022!!! The new year is not off to a great start. People are defecting to the DPRK. How bad is your life when living in North Korea sounds like a good idea. We are right back at the brink of World War III with imminent thermal nuclear Holocaust shortly after. And we are now in the 4th calendar year of a plague that has turned my life upside down. I’ve been separated from family, unable to visit my nation of birth. Then getting trapped in the USA, hooked on drugs, going into rehab, coming out of the closet and transitioning among some of the most conservative citizens of my country, fellow veterans. I’m know technically homeless due to COVID. I can’t fly home to the country I live in because the border is closed. On the first day of the new year I was reported by fellow veterans for “being uncomfortable “ with how I dress. Why doesn’t staff tell them to get over it, too damn bad? Instead nursing had to document what I was wearing and conclude there was absolutely nothing wrong with what I was wearing. This happens fairly regularly. Please understand I do not wear everything I pose in pictures for. When I have actual groups I dress more conservative. But when I get a knock at my door asking for coffee, I’m not going to change first before I show you wear I keep the free communal coffee. For someone to then complain on what I’m wearing at 6:00 am New Year’s Day after I help them is ridiculous. I am still in the men’s wing. At Night guys will wear what ever they want or lack of clothing. But I get told I have to be considerate and not leave my room in pajamas to watch TV. It becomes discrimination when I’m the only one held to that rule. Literally every male veteran is allowed to leave their room in their pajamas with out issue, so telling only me that I can’t do the same is selectively enforcing a rule, aka discrimination. Thank God the nursing staff is so awesome and educated. They are with the times and are my tether to reality. I feel like I’m living in the 1990s  or even earlier the way some people act and think I should. Did you know in 1990 the world health organization removed homosexuality from the list of diseases? People under the LGBTQ umbrella have been segregated in the past and isolated with people that have diseases like leprosy. That is why I took such offense when they wanted to move me to the COVID wing. It is west people go to be quarantined if they may have been exposed to COVID. I would have literally been segregated with people that may be sick. Staff did not seem to grasp the optics of how that looked. Rather than house me in the female wing as outlined in federal and VA policy they wanted to isolate me in a section for people that needed quarantine due to a disease. I’m glad when I objected my concern was taken seriously. But to this day issues constantly arise amongst other  make veterans that are living in my wing. It hurts because my room is next to the TV area and I can hear everything that is said out there. On a few occasions I have heard people on the phone talking about me in very hurtful ways. They smile to my face and act nice but say some very disturbing things when they think I’m not around. I don’t feel I gave much support on how it makes me feel when my mental health provider refuses to call me “Trish” because they disagree with me being transgender. I feel they look at it as a mental illness as they directly told me it’s not a real thing to be accepted as normal and ok. I am reminded of this each time I’m called by my last name. I’m not much closer to wanting to remain permanently sober. A lot has happened this past month. I’m lost, alone, and unsure. I’m trying my hardest to come to terms with who I am, but it’s not easy. I’m still very confused and scared. Happy new year to everyone. Hugs and kisses to all that support me 🥰. </p>

<p class="card-body"> Hello! It’s almost 2022. It is already 2022 in many parts of the world. Let me know where you are from in the comments. This will be Trish’s first Bew Years. I hope for a very different year in 2022. I hope to actually live in 2022, not just survive. I look forward to doing a lot, but only if COVID comes to some sort of conclusion and the world opens up a little. I also hope that I get some sort of mental health/substance abuse treatment from the VA. With COVID causing so many problems in the USA I have not received enough rehab, nothing really to reach my desire to use. It still lies just below the service ready by take over again. I have so much in my head I’m trying to digest and understand. Who am I? That is my main question. Will i ever truly be loved for who I am or will I be alone? What is my purpose and what will I do to leave a positive mark on the world? I have slacked of for so many years of my life and I do t have a lot of good years left. I need to make the once I have left count. I’m still working I. My place in the world . I miss having friends, the largest thing I lost in my transition was people actually talking to me, instead the usually talk at me. Many times due to their asimyablut me we don’t have deep conversations and they usually center around a topic that is artificial. I will work on who I am In this new year. It’s been hard because many close to me rejected me so hard. I developed a negative image when I talk to them, an image I don’t have away from them.. I hope I can fix that. 2022 here I come …. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> 29-12-2021 </p>
<p class="card-body"> Yesterday I was a bit Victorian. It’s so difficult being judged based on people’s assumptions of how I am. Media and TV in the USA generally associates people that look like me as weak and helpless. As less than a man, as a sissy. Why is it that because I like how I look, like wearing a certain fashion make me any less capable of killing? I say it like that because I was a marine, I was an infantryman in the US Army. The main job of an infantryman is to kill the enemy until they surrender. There is no way to dress it up. I wore a uniform and participated in the shameful act of war. Why because I no longer wear that uniform am I any less capable of anything now? I never scored less than 270 on the PT test. Usually well over 300. I was an expert shot. I scored 400 on my E-4 evaluation before I became an NCO. Yet constantly I am underestimated of what I am capable of. Other veterans see how I dress and assume I could not possibly have seen combat, that my injury could not be a combat injury. I am 100% service connected from a combat injury “as a direct result of combat with the enemy in a time of war.” Is verbatim what my med board wrote when they retired me. I miss my military career so much. On deployments we all wore on uniform despite who we may have been in our civilian world. It no longer mattered, in this one moment in time of our lives we had all found ourself in a life or death situation where we had to put our life in the hands of the soldier to our right and to our left with out question of how they identified, at that moment we all identified as an American weapon of war. No more, no less. Life was simple. Today everywhere in society we try and separate our self from others. WE ARE ALL HUMAN. I am an American, one of the most privileged citizens in existent. But I want to be grouped with all those citizens of earth. We need to come together for the good of all people, not just the select few we identify with. I hurt as I hear the hell that rains down on Afghanistan, a country on the other side of the world. I cried today listening to the blight of women on NPR taking about all the lies the taliban spread to return to power. All promises the reneged on. Is it because I became disabled in that country? I list so many brothers and sisters over there? I still wake up screaming to a wet bed from nightmares of when I was there, or on a human level do I just connect on suffering being universal? Does it matter? Today Afghanistan is in my prayers as are all those that suffer while the world turns a deaf ear to their plight . Hugs and kisses to everyone out there. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s the day after Christmas . I don’t know why I suffer from depression at such great length. I have so much to be thankful for but it seems meaningless to me at times. Why can’t I feel good? I feel so miserable in the winter. Every hurts, I gave no emery and I just want to sleep . I wish I was manic. I got sent to the hospital against my will today because I said I have contemplated suicide before. By punishing me the way they did they make talking about suicide a taboo subject that just leads yo more veteran suicide. I was trying to talk with staff so I would not be so depressed. Said I hate that the thought of suicide enters my head as intrusive thoughts . I said I would only ever kill my self to save the life of others like my children or if I was going up die a terrible death, like if I had a lethal dose of radiation. So I got pricked for blood, isolated for hours causing extra stress and making me more depressed. I felt humiliated the way some EMT worlds joked about the last time when I act did try to kill my self a few days after I was sexually assaulted. That time o had said for days I needed help, felt so dirty and did not want ho live. I didn’t get any help that time. Yet know I explain why I am depressed and I get sent off to be evaluated. Complete waste of time ruining my holiday worse than yesterday. My Christmas&nbsp; was also ruined by someone that always puts me down, calls me ugly, says I’m sick and disgusting, decided to harass me on Christmas&nbsp; . The only family member to contact me ruined my Christmas&nbsp; . didn’t hear from my kids either. Their mothers love asking for money but early have my kids call or instill any type of respect . Oh well. So yes my holiday&nbsp; has absolutely sucked. I’m alone, I’m ostracized, I have no friends, and with COVID I am not really getting anything out of rehab. NA and AA have basically been suspended, class’s and groups can not function effectively at 10 minutes of time. 20 minutes classes must end, leaving only 10 minutes after attendance and settling down. Who ever came up with the COVID mitigation have no idea what they are doing. I told a relative in the California state health department working on COVID issues and was told they are completely pointless, just meant to look good on paper. If someone has Covid and they infect the person running the class or group, they will then infect the rest of the group. Completely idiotic . Smoking is still allowed. A few people either left property or had people come on to the property as cigarettes and chew are easily available on the black market again. It’s a complete joke that the issue that caused COVID is allowed to continue. Well I know I have so much to be thankful for. But when the people you care about hurt you over and over again, life seems pointless. When people are nice but then horrible it feels like they were never nice. I guest it just hurts to be completely ignored and abandoned by those you love so much. It hurts to not be accepted for who you are only to be rejected for how you look. I Knie im beautiful. I can say with confidence I am smarter and better looking , better off financially than most of The people I’m in rehab with sinclufinf staff. Despite having so much positive I’m still depressed wanting to drink or use . I hate feeling this way. My emotions are out of control. I go from numb to overwhelmed. My biggest hole in my heart is my kids. I miss them the most. My deployment to Afghanistan took almost everything I held dear away from me. I lost so much on that deployment in 2010. Still trying to shake that darkness. Merry Christmas&nbsp; everyone . 10 more days if Christmas&nbsp; left! Hugs 🫂 and kisses 😘 to everyone !!! Love y’all!!! </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Merry Christmas to those waking up today and happy Christmas eve to the rest. Its Chris day this will be my most lonely Christmas of my life, ever reminding me of just how painful life can be. Christmas is supposed to be a time of family and friends to get together and celebrate. Please take the time to appreciate the people you have around you at Christmas . It’s been a painful time of year ever since I was injured in Afghanistan and hadn’t see. My kids all year. I worked so hard to recover in time for Christmas only to be served with court papers saying I basically could not see my kids on Christmas . a huge heart brake after all the planing Kỳ family did to accommodate my injuries then unable to celebrate Christmas with my own daughters after a year of fighting abroad then fighting for my life then fighting to walk and talk again after a TBI. Then a few years ago I lost my grandfather on Christmas eve . One of the most important and influential people of my life. This is “Trishes” first Christmas . this will be  my first Christmas sober in a long time. The past few years I was sad I was away from my country, now I am in my country but in a hospital completely alone with. No friends or family. I can truly undetermined why so many people kill themself this time of year. It can really beg the question of “what’s the point”. I still have some fight left in me. Not all of my family has abandoned me. I still have some great support. I’m lucky for that. What will the new year bring I have no idea, but I’m grateful to have the opportunity to at least have a chance. I’m at so blessed for everything that I have and all many talents. I do never realized how strong many minorities and marginalized people of society are. The amount of daily bull shit I deal with is insane. I find even good hearted people discriminating using excuse they don’t understand in them self are deeply seeded in ignorant views. Telling me It would not be appropriate for me to do certain things is saying what to me? There is something wrong with how I am. If I can’t perform certain tasks or represent certain organizations there must be something wrong with who I am. This must have been a constant message others have been givin. I have specifically asked to be able to to do certain things. And it hurts every time I see other people are allowed to do it, so the excuse I was given was bull shit. It really tests my faith sometimes. I feel I have no one to turn to. People seem to avoid me line the plague. Hopefully the next year will reunite me with my family. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night 😘 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Why is it so damn hard for some people to use the correct pronouns? I’m surrounded by veterans. That means for part of their life they where in the military and how the addressed some one was based on a small 1 inch x inch square that had rank. Sometimes the specials rank and Lt. colonel looked very similar but how you addressed them was very different. How is it people could use the proper rank so easily ? There were over 18 possibilities x 5 separate branches. Almost 100 different ranks, similar to needing to keep track of 100  pronouns . I look distinctly different from a he/him/his, I am not ambiguous the way they/their/them can sometimes look. I distinctly look like her/hers/she!!! Yet I’m still constantly being referred to as a male!!! Is it because the VA continues to place me in the wrong area? It blows people’s minds that work at the VA in other places that I am in the make area. Despite very clear federal guidelines that this is unacceptable and a violation of the federal directive it’s still taking place. Still being referred to with the male pronouns is another way of calling me a crazy man in woman’s cloths showing a complete disregard for how I feel. My psychologist will only use my last name, refuses to call me Trish despite being listed on my records and avoids pronouns at all costs. At least they have found a clever way to keep to their belief with out being purposely disrespectful. I’m a veteran , in a VA facility can deal with being referred to by my last name the way I was when I wore a uniform . It’s not optimal, but it’s a definite compromise to them using definite male pronouns or my birth name. Besides that it’s gotten to the point of absolute insanity on what basic rights to veteran patients has been suspended due to COVID. The latest casualty is keeping coffee at the coffee maker. Coffee is sn absolute right at DOMs in Washington, Oregon, and California. Here I see it as a right as well. It should be the one thing available to vets when the enter rehab and need something to remind them of normal life. Many can’t afford their own coffee. I went a week suffering because I did not have access to my money and no veteran would share. Now the administration prefers people smoke. No coffee Leads to more choosing to smoke, the black market always gives freebies in hopes of future customers. It’s so Insane we can’t have coffee because of COVID, but smoking is allowed. An Avenue That Kay be responsible for a future COVID outbreak. Thank you for everyone’s support. Love you all 😘 🥰  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> (I am in rehab at a Veterans hospital. I am a disabled combat veteran that fought in Afghanistan and was severely injured)  </p>
<p class="card-body"> So COVID finally hit the DOM. I said this would happen right before Christmas over a month ago. I don’t know how the person caught it so I won’t speculate on their case. But in general the administration turning a blind eye to the no smoking policy and allowing vets to smoke on a smoke free VA is putting everyone’s sobriety at risk. Allowing people to smoke had created a black market that is very lucrative. Not everyone that leaves rehab grounds unauthorized goes to buy tobacco and bring it back, but 90% do. So many veterans blatantly smoke yet they don’t sell cigarettes here. So of course they are being brought in by people that leave. Unfortunately COVID can also be brought back from one of these escapades. So by administrators not clamping down and enforcing the no smoking policy the same as the no drinking policy they are directly responsible for the increased risk of COVID spreading and closing a program I desperately need. If staff smells alcohol on you, you get questioned and searched. If you smell like smoke nothing happens. I hate that my health is directly effected by people’s third hand smoke. The halls reek of smoke giving me a headache , runny scratchy eyes, my throat closes up and my asthma is inflated. Again administration does not seem concerned about my health and others health superseding the cravings of addicts in recovery to continue to use their drug of choice and slowly kill themself. Unfortunately the presence of third hand smoke is also effecting my health. I have been sick for over a week now. I keep getting tested for COVID, all negative. So when I’m walking the halls or lying in my bed and I get gist with concentrations smoke, I puke. When I’m getting my medication at the nurses window and the garbage is full of stinky cigarette butts, I gag. Smokers complete disregard for non smokers is ridiculous. They see no problem walking into a group with out showering and brushing their teeth after smoking causing hard ships on many fellow veterans, I’m not speaking alone. I am part of a large group of no smokers that have been pushing the patient advocate to do sonst. Maybe now that smoking may have caused a COVID outbreak, something will be done about it. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> What are crazy weekend. My mood has been terrible! People have made it worse. I have not been getting sleep and some people kept me up all night . I’m trying so hard to forgive and get over things that people have done to hurt me, but I’m not there yet. I don’t trust people anymore. I can only be hurt so many times before I loose trust in humans. I just don’t want to keep getting hurt by people I care about. I get treated like being who I am is a choice. I can’t help who i am. I am who I am and I can’t change that. The more i try and deny who I am the more turmoil I cause for myself and I get so confused. When I’m like that I will drink or use. I feel so lost, So confused. I feel as if I may be alone forever and remain forever unloved for the person I am. I really don’t know what to do anymore  . I think about my 3 choices; suicide, return to drugs and/or alcohol, or a sober life. Those are my three future possibilities that argue in my head  constantly. I just want to love and be loved. I have never been alone for this long before. I pray things will get better. I need to fight my suicidal ideology and drug cravings. I need help, I’m not getting you from those I need it from most. I wore my “my little pony dress” I made today. I liked it. Happy Sunday.I’m stressed if I will ever get home to Vietnam 🇻🇳. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> What am I? I am a transbian . It is a combination of the word trans and lesbian. I am a transgender woman attracted to other woman, a transbian. I am so lucky to be married to a living wife. If I was single I must admit it would be very hard to date. I have been reading the plight of other transgender woman. Why am I still so hostile to other transgender woman? I don’t like looking at them if they still look very masculine. I don’t know why I dislike my own kind so much??? I’m so confused on that. I am also so depressed. I am craving narcotics. I don’t know what to do when the other personality takes over in my head. That person does not care what happens to our life. Nothing you say to me when I switch over to the other person will persuade me to get help. Hopefully since I’m already in rehab I will get help. I’m just so alone. I wish I could show people here I’m not what the think. I hate being ostracized. Is it really so hard to eat lunch with me? I try and sit with the new people. Unfortunately I don’t feel I’m well liked. I feel like if I was still using I could get along. Everyone that is still active in their addiction socialize while using cigarettes here. I don’t want to loose my sobriety by breaking the rules and using a substance to satisfy a craving. It’s so tempting. I wish I could compromise my understanding of how tobacco works and just start smoking again. It’s so hard to stay sober when I can smell it on everyone . I constantly see people using openly. This being a Tobacco free VA facility is a joke. It hard seeing fellow veteran ls havecsuch disrespect for federal guidelines, it Reminds me that they don’t really respect federal institutions. Narcotics and alcohol kill the body slowly. Smoking kills the same way, no one is smoking for its health benifits. Oh well in another 10 years tobacco will be completely illegal. I just need to maintain my sobriety in spite of do many around me not taking recovery seriously at all. They may think they are, but if the return to another rehab they will hopefully know they did not take it seriously . I just wish I had more support from my fellow veterans. I’m struggling so much and not getting many people to attend groups for recovery with me. I hate being told we are all the same as addicts in recovery. That is bull shit. There are those that are not taking recovery seriously at all. Those that think they are, but are not. And those really striving to not return to rehab, it’s been 20 years since I was in rehab last. I’m happy going another 20 years. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I hate being bipolar. I can feel the darkness of depression creeping in on me. I feel lost. People never remember the things you did for them, the times you where there for them. How you sacrificed your teens, twenties and early 30s for them, they only remember the person after you are not devoted to complete sacrifice for them. Had I known I would be judged so harshly and blamed so strongly for things out of my control I would not have suffered through the hell of such abusive relationships because I thought it was I was supposed to do. I wasted so much of my life trying to please others. I really don’t know what The rest of my life looks Like. When I start to feel this way I wonder why not go back to drugs. Sometimes it just hurts that much. I don’t want to get through it. I just don’t care about life. I’m lucky I figured out who I truly was and just how much nonsense I believed that my mother instilled in me. When absolute insanity goes unchecked, people grow up with very warped views on the world. My mother openly talked about how pointless life was constantly. I would always ask her what she was looking for and be told “the meaning to life”. I had no idea what she meant. I know understand. That is a very good question. If nothing really matters, is life just about being happy? If it is, why not just get high? It’s not the right answer to my problems but it is the easier route. I really need to snap out of this highway to hell my depression is going full speed into. I don’t know what to do. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> My pink cloud is definitely dissipating. I am scared of the person that will take over soon. I get debilitating depression. So bad I won’t get out of bed. I will shower maybe once  a week. I feel like life is pointless and the dream world is far mor me real than this reality I’m awake in. It’s the weather. I hate cold weather with very short days. The son does not rise until almost 8am and sets after 4pm. That sucks!!!! I need my long sunny days. Me seasonal depression is real. I hope I can maintain some sort of control and force my self to do things. Being so isolated and ostracized . I feel so alone. There is no one left here at the VA rehab that I am aware of that is willing to be my friend. I’m just a fellow veteran at best as far as most are concerned. I just found my self fantasizing about shooting up. My cravings are so strong. I might try a few AA or NA meeting, but like many veterans that don’t go anymore say, too much Glorifying drug usage. I just nodded out again in bed. Wow!!! I NEED HELP SO BAD!!!! I CANT CONTROL THIS 😢. I love and miss my family so much! CK❤️VK mãi mãi. Love you world !!!i B am binge eating like crazy !!! </p>

				<p class="card-body">  I’m bipolar or do the doctors tell me. I was manic in August. By November it calmed down. Now I’m going head first into depression and I HATE IT!! I am constantly thinking  about drugs slabs alcohol. I miss that high, ripping me out of depression. I started sleeping to much again. I fell asleep at 3pm and Almosen missed dinner. My binge eating is absolutely out of control. I’m really getting so lonely. When I played the character Peter or Patrick I had lots of friends. I had no problems which people and could have conversations with everyone. It hurts sometimes not having Anyone interested in me as a friend. It’s either a sexual attraction to me that I do not reciprocate or online. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I hope I’m not getting judged for what I say in a recovery class. I was really hoping tgat stayed in the group. I guess I woukd judge another transwoman, so it’s not so surprising people are towards me. I’m scared the depressed person in me will come out. They don’t care if I live or die, stay sober or get high. I hate how I feel when I must pay the piper for my mania. Depression is a dark lonely, scary place.  #transgender #trans #lgbt #lgbtq #gay #lesbian #pride #queer #bisexual #nonbinary #ftm #loveislove #mtf #transisbeautiful #transgirl #transwoman #pansexual #genderfluid #love #asexual #lgbtqia #gaypride #transpride #transexual #tgirl #bi #lgbtpride #girlslikeus #lgbtveterans #lgbtqveterans </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It seems everyone I got to know in rehab that accepted me has left. For the first time I am finding myself eating alone. Isolating in my room. It’s a struggle to be myself and be happy or change how I look and not be so alone. My personality as a male was always seen as a positive strong leadership role. As a trans female im seen as annoying, know it all, negative, and stubborn. For every positive trait I had as a male, I still have it but it’s viewed as a negative. Although I’m not used to the present company. I just can’t relate on some level to the mentality that some people have. It’s been a learning experience. I used to see great injustice of the past and wonder how good people could stand by and do nothing. I understand it now. They had no idea how wrong their way of thinking was. I see it today. So many people still think like people did in the 20th century. Only with time will the younger generation overtake the older generation. I’m trying gi do my part to do what I can. And that is enough. Every day I get up and try my best to be the best me and to bring positivity and try and help others. If I keep doing that I have done my part. 😊  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so homesick! I miss Home so much. My hone is in Vietnam. I miss the weather, the heat, the food, the people, the smells, the culture. I miss it all. I took for granted daily life. I’m so lost and alone back in New York. This is not my home anymore. The west coast and Hawaii are, but not New York. I don’t eat the type of food offered here. I don’t complain but it’s nothing like I have eaten 1/3 of my life. I just forgot how ignorant and insensitive people are. It never seemed that way out west. Is it an Easy coast thing that keep so many people closed minded? I truly appreciate the few awesome pedi have come across. It’s hard when I see people that think they have been dealt an unfair hand in life and think I some his have it easier. Just because I don’t ever have to worry about money does not mean I don’t have to worry. In fact having money makes things more difficult sometimes. Not having money keeps me cut off from doing really crazy things. Allowed my addiction to go out of control with out negative consequences with the law or withdrawal from lack of money. The only times j did not have drugs was when the drug dealers didn’t. I stayed drunk or high most of my life to deal with having the wrong body. I can remember being in kindergarten when I first stated to notice I did not want to be a boy, or do boy things. I only wanted to play with the girls . I was accepted as one of the girls. In fact most my life I have always been accepted as one of the girls. For July and August at the VA I was accepted that way as well. But those females left. My world got pretty messed up here for a bit, but am back on track. I was told they are probably changing my room. As per federal guidelines i am not being housed correctly and is in direct violation of federal policy. I’m still confused why transgender female veterans tgst wherr here before stayed in the transgender room, but I got assigned to the male wing. I was told it said I was male in their system. A mistake on the VA end. I don’t understand why no one ever asked me that question ??? Well I’ll see what happens next week. It has really messed with my head the way I’m housed. It allows other veterans to treat me the wrong way. When the VA houses me with men I’m viewed as a crazy guy in a dress. When the VA housed me correctly it lets people know there belief is wrong and dying out. I hate that the VA us helping reinforce negative beliefs on transgender veterans, I really don’t understand why I can use the female bathrooms, but am housed with men. The federal government views me as a female and for medical purposes I was born with the male gender. I am no longer identified as male and not to be treated as a male while in federal property, except when medically necessary. Stay tuned and see how long until the VA does the right thing. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m happy I was able to leave rehab at the VA for the day to go to Buffalo NY for my appointment with immigration (USCIS). It amazes me how redundant things with my government are. The DoD (Department of Defense) has all my biometrics, my fingerprint, my pictures, hell even a DNA sample. I had a security clearance. Do the two agencies Talk??? No!!! They are supposed to help military families but so far they have only screwed up my case. Despite telling them things over and over , they still have it wrong. Anyway today was my first time in public in months. I had so many compliments from the nice people in Buffalo. Also all the immigration staff at USCIS Where super friendly. Hopefully my immigration starts to get processed. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Tomorrow we are having a stand down at the Bath VA. On the schedule they say there will be an hour of LGBTQ education and resources. I hope it’s taken seriously or if people just skip out on it or it’s just hanging out pamphlets. I’m curious what resources they claim we get in Bath. I gave requested services many times . The best I’ve Gotten is a phone call every other month. There is no LGBTQ coordinator like the VA falsely claims they have on site. No counseling or telehealth. No advocate or help in very confusing matters. I hope they don’t claim to have resources that are not available. If I’m told I had options these past four months I’m gonna call their bull shit. I’ve screamed at the top of my lungs for help and not received it. I have had my basic needs net. I just mean sometimes the VA talks about programs and resources tgst don’t exist. Either way in happy it’s at least listed. I seem to be one of the very open LGBTQ veterans at the DOM. But I know of 13 other LGBTQ veterans here that are not so open. So who knows, there may be even more.  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I was born and raised in New York 🇺🇸, I have never lined the cold. I hate the cold. I did something more New Yorkers that hate winter shoukd do, I moved! But the west coast was still too cold, so I moved to Hawaii 🌺. I am still a resident of Hawaii, but then I moved to Hanoi Vietnam 🇻🇳. But it’s too dam hot! I am line ocean coral, I only thrive with in a 4 degree margin. Between 68-72 F (20-22C) anything outside of that is either too hot 🥵 or too cold 🥶. I can survive though between 62-82 F. That is my zen temperate zone. Being trapped in NY due to COVID and the fact I did too many drugs and an an alcoholic, I am in rehab at the Bath VA. I don’t go outside anymore. I get very depressed in the winter with the short days. I feel alone and I isolate. I don’t have many friends, and almost no friends here in rehab. But that can be a good thing. Besides my wife, Michele and Waman are my only friends. I’m going to try and make some more, just people here only see my outside and don’t usually get to know the actual person I am. People make a lot of assumptions based on how I dress that are usually wrong! I’m LGBTQ , but only the “T” really applies to me. Depending on your definition of Queer, I could also be “Q”. But being LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 Does not mean I am gay or bi. Only my gender is affected. But I guess I am a Gay transgender woman, or a heterosexual man depending on how you look at me </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I was a sailer today. I love being a girl. I’m finally happy in my core, but I still get depressed. I still get lonely. I really don’t know what to do. I try and be nice, be a pleasant person. I won’t go back to pretending to Ge someone I’m not just to fit in. But it’s hard not having anyone that actually talk talks to me. All my friends have left the VA. I’m trying to make new friends but it’s not going easy. It’s okay. I guess it would be the same I certain other situations where you are amongst a higher concentration of undesirables. The kind of People you really don’t want to Be friends with. Despite friends and family in the outside reminding me constantly to remember I’m amongst addicts, cheats, liars and thief’s. There is a part of me that still believes there are some people worth getting to know. We are not bad people, just people that have made poor choices. I’m not here to fix people, but sometimes it’s so hard hearing the things I hear out of peoples mouth. In some respects I feel I’m back in jr high. I need to learn how to be humble and just let people think I believe their bull shit. But the bull shit here is getting pretty deep. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so confused 🤔. Who am I, what am I? I feel myself but I don’t know what that means. How can I feel so absolutely normal and look the way I do? It’s hurts when I remember some people still have a very backwards thought process, but it feels good to be on the right side of history. I just wish the VA had an actual LGBTQ coordinator like they are supposed to and list in their website. There are ala few other LGBTQ vets that are not public also wishing we had more resources at our disposal. I need someone to help guide me in my recovery. So far I can not relate to most of the relapse classes. I never had “fun” using. I always did it to block out and ignore things. I needed to numb my body from the memory of trauma, great loss and anger of being in a body I did not want. Now that I have found myself , i need to learn who I am.  I am loosing time and my memory is untrustworthy. I missed my best friends birthday! I’m so sorry Michele. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s not today, it won’t be tomorrow, but eventually it will be. I’m hoping in 20 years the world will look very different, especially here in the United States. I see a world where there are no men’s clothes, there are no women’s clothes, they’re just clothes. They’re only people that are human. And humans will be free to dress however they want, and act however they want without being forced into a specific gender category. Today, in the world I live in I am forced to take sides. I must choose female because it is the gender I identify with. But I only identify as female because based on what society has determined male and female gender roles are, how they identify genders, hi felt I had to pick one. Saying I did not identify or was non-binary did not get me the results I want it. I was still treated exactly as if I was a man. Only ones identified as a transgender woman did I truly get treated more closely to how I felt. Even for me it’s going to take some getting used to. Hearing the pronoun she, her, is not something I’m used to hearing. Do I like it? Yes I love it I feel validated. But it’s new to me never before in my life have I been treated with the respect and dignity I used to only dream of having. Sometimes I have to remember just how far behind the times people are, where I’m at. I get frustrated that people act as if they are having to do something radical. This is not radical change this is been 10 years of it being a certain way. And the way I feel some people look at the subject of me being transgender is that this is something completely new to them. OK I understand that some people have never lived in an ethnic neighborhood, they grew up in an all white neighborhood so I understand the whole running in the people you’re not used to or have never been used to take some getting used to. But that’s exactly what it is people that I’ve always been here, but you just haven’t gotten to know  in your world. I’m just a person. If you lump me into all “trans” you are being prejudice. I am as different as every woman yet share some common similarities. But please don’t tell me you have a trans friend so you know how i am. Maybe you better understand my struggles. The Same struggles every one in the trans community faces. But PLEASE DONT TELL KE I GAVEXA CHOICE AND I CHOOSE THIS LIFE. I chose life, and in choosing life, I an me. When I was forced to be a person I was not, and had not Will to live and not purpose. So drugs and alcohol became my purpose. Having a purpose again and being the real me has been so liberating. I am finally a form of happy!!! </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m so lucky to be happy. So many people are not happy. I realized that my unhappiness came from me denying who I was/am. I was suffering needless. I accept tgat addiction is suffering, si Long as I give in to my addiction I will suffer. To suffer is so many different things. I keep gettin told  in groups that we need to radically change our lives . I have dramatically changed my life. I am reaping the rewards of my new life. Drug and alcohol are longer parts of my life. Now I am trying to deal with the root of my addiction and pain . I am embracing my wife’s religion and following Buddhism much . I am reading refugee recovery and leading a meeting. I can truly relate to it. Well it’s almost 12am. I need to try and sleep 😴 😘  </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I keep getting reminded how different the East coast is from the west coast. Certain ideals that I thought were concrete are not. People can look at me two ways. They can see that I was born a female but assigned a male body. Or they see me as a mentally ill man in a woman’s dress. Those that claim it is something in between just don’t like to admit to the reality of what the are actually saying. Those are the Only two choices. Religion is a Choice. One may choose what imaginary man (God is not imaginary , but the idea of a man in the sky is , in my mind) lives in the clouded deciding who’s prayers he will listen to and whose he will ignore. What religion one believes depends on what religion their parents Where 90% of the time. But people can be converted to another religion. Religion is definitely something one can choose. Yet we take religious rights very seriously, we do not belittle ones religion. We never tell people it’s all in their head. Or their belief in God is a choice they choose to believe. People can understand that fact.  How insensitive it would be to serve a Jew or Muslim Pork, a Catholic meat during lent, to not make accommodations to Christians to worship on Sunday.  Homosexuality is something that used to be considered a mental illness. Up until almost 1970, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness. You could not openly serve in the military until 2011 if you where any spectrum other than straight. It’s no longer socially acceptable to call someone a “fag”. These changes did not come overnight and they did not come easily, but they certainly where not just given. These changes had to be forced, radical change in thought was needed. People no longer tolerated being treated less than equal, as subhuman. It amazes me in 2021 how different this part of the country thinks compared to the west coast even 10 years ago. I was wrong on what I was even arguing. I did not realize people still think I have a choice. If you live a lie or live the truth is a choice, then it’s true I have a choice. Many times the argument of race comes up. Usually the argument is that it is more difficult if you are an ethnic minority because you can not change you skin. I would argue it is actually easier if you can’t change you color. It forces society to deal with the issue because it is not something that can be changed. Gender identity and sexual identity is not as black and white. So society expects it to be kept quite or it’s ignored. Since technically it a choice to live in the open or in the closet it makes it that much harder to be yourself. When you have the choice to live a lie but be treated with privilege in society or to be your self and to be met with transphobia, and prejudice (prejudice does not only apply to race) it says monumental things about how much it must hurt to the soul to live a lie. Also when you are born a certain color you do not have to deal with people delegitimizing you by claiming you have a choice to be who you are. In the past to Ge clear I would never compare the wrong pronoun being used in me at the same level as an ethnic slur. What my argument was in the past was If I called a man “Mrs”, he would not stand for it and would take it as a direct attack on his manhood and ask I correct if. If one tells ne it’s not the same if someone calls me “Mr” I would reply that they are just behind in their thinking. In fact, I would argue it’s far worse an insult when I’m called “Mr” and it’s not corrected. That is a person directly calling mr a crazy man in woman’s cloths . And that statement hurts. It happened again today from another staff member that did not correct her statement of “being the only woman in the room”. This led everyone else in the room to continue saying she is the only woman in the room. It became so overwhelming I had to leave. Fortunately one person did recognize what had happened and spoke up for me and against the situation, and that group acknowledged the wrong. I felt good people in that group had the intestinal fortitude to stand up for what was right.   </p>
<p class="card-body"> That staff member did come to my room and apologize. That really helped validate my existence. I try and get people used to me for the next trans veteran. I don’t think people realize how man of the 22 that end their life each day are from the LGBTQ community. That being called a crazy man in woman’s cloths could have been enough to push me over the edge. I’m much stronger and realize not everyone is at the same place. But that is the reason the federal government has policy. If some people are not ready to accept certain things, then no I do not think they should work in for the federal government if the won’t follow the guidelines. Would you be okay with staff disrespecting your religion, ethnicity, or sexuality? If the answer is no, why is it okay they disrespect me as a human and my gender? People are stuck with the idea that gender is determined by what is between ones legs. That is no longer the only definition. The dictionary Definition nie says gender does not correspond to traditional ideas of what is male or female. Too many people are working with an outdated definition of gender, a definition that has changed. I am the gender I say I am. Gender is a NOT defined by anatomy or biology. A female can face a penis and a male can have a vagina. Once you understand this is true under the definition of gender, you may be better able to understand my argument and why I get offended at being called “Mr”. The federal law is that simple as well and uses that definition. Just by coincidence I had this conversation with multiple people today, and appreciate them being so honest.  </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender- 1.either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural  </p>
<p class="card-body"> differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas with all this beautiful snow. I may have been born and raised in New York (Poughkeepsie, Plattsburgh, and Rochester) but I was told if I don’t like the cold to move. Well joining the Army took me to some pretty hot places. Beautiful sandy beaches with out an ocean. I headed west to to California, Washington and Oregon. That was Stil to cold so I went to Hawaii. I kept my hone on Oahu but could not sit still on an island. So I lived I Vietnam until Covid got me trapped in the USA this year. I ended up in rehab, and I’m still here. Today I checked on my plants in my greenhouse and went to church today for advent. Now I’m cleaning my room. It’s an absolute disaster, but I will get it up to par. I’m trying to take my mind off a certain person I love and care about treating me like a deviant. I was told there was something wrong with me my whole life. It hurts to be called terrible or told I’m a different person on the inside because I look different on the outside. I’m staying strong, I need to move past the negative people in my life. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Growing up a white male I had plenty of positive role models. What I did not have any of, where positive role models portraying the transgender community. I did not even know what transgender was. Unfortunately It wasn’t until to my mid 30s That I had an understanding of what transgender was. As a child and a young adult all images of a male wearing what I thought of as female clothing were negative. The stereo typical transgender female in my head was something negative. It seem to me in the media, in movies, on TV, I was sent a very negative message about what transgender was. I did not understand the transgender, transvestite, cross-dresser, and drag queens were all lumped together as one. Constantly seeing such negative images of what I thought I was, of who I thought I was. I developed a very negative self image of who I was. This led to low self-esteem, this led to low confidence, I thought I was dumb, stupid, an idiot. I felt I must be perverted, social deviant, I even thought I was going to hell for a while. Religion can be a dangerous thing on a young mind. When I hear parents talk about them not wanting LGBTQ curriculum taught in the classroom to their children I have to ask myself why? And I realize it’s because some of the same parents that say they are excepting of the LGBT community are terrified that their children might be LGBTQ. Had I had any type of education and what any of these things meant my life could’ve been so different. I realize I grew up in a different time. I do not want any tiles today to have the life I had simply due to lack of education. I was done a great disservice by having such negative images bombarded on me constantly. No matter how much compliments I received, how many times I was told I was smart or handsome, I felt disgusting on the inside because of all the insults slung at people I could relate to. No one came right out and insulted me, that’s only because I never told anyone my true feelings about how I felt. I can’t believe that nobody ever noticed I had absolutely no real guy friends, always hung out and played with the girls, for god sake I didn’t play with G.I. Joe I had Barbie and cabbage patch kids. I dressed up in my sisters clothing whenever I could I cried for weeks when my mother told me I could never have babies. I can remember the time in my life when I understood how important gender was. Up until the point my mother explain the differences about babies and I was in kindergarten maybe first grade, I was five or six years old. I honestly thought the only difference between boys and girls were the boys could Pee standing up and girls had a sit down, which my sister prove to me was wrong when she showed me she could Pee standing up.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ I really would like to see more positive role models out there. I love hearing about other transgender veterans that have gone through what I’m going through. I hope my experience at rehab can hopefully turn a negative into a positive for the next transgender veteran that ends up in rehab. That although they may be the only one at the time they’re not alone. That’s the only message I want to get out, is that you are not alone. My whole life I have felt so alone, so very alone, deep dark aloneness that only alcohol and drugs could comfort me. I am so happy to realized I am not alone, I am one unique individual of many unique individuals. Alone I am still strong, but together we are invincible. Thank you to all those that support me each day sending me texts of motivation. I truly appreciate it.￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> 4 months ago had you called me Mr., I woukd have responded with out issues.3 months ago I would ask you just use my last name with out title. 2 months ago I’d ask to just be called Pat, last month I’d ask to be Trish. Today when I’m called “mr” when you can plainly see I am not trying to identify with “mr” in anyway, I get hurt, I get angry, I get so upset I want to cry. It did not bother me before because I did not have the self confidence to claim the title or “miss/mrs”. I now know who I am. Finding myself has been the key to my sobriety. All my life I have felt so out of place, so wrong, and so lost. Today I am confident in my ability to live clean and sober. I understand life far better than before. I truly love myself and who I am. All I ask is to be treated as a human with dignity. It hurt so much to ge called “Mr” for line the 10th time by a person I had talked with. I show respect to them, yet not one person spoke out, not one word from the person. Had anyone insulted a fellow veteran with such a manner as to discredit their very existence, I would have spoke out. I’m finding that is the difference. I have integrity and others are two fearful to do or say what is right. People look back at shameful times in American history and like to think they would stick up for the under class, act line they would have walked side by side the civil rights champions, yet when they have a very real opportunity they fall silent. And act as if there is no problem. The ignoring the issue of my continued treatment as less than human really stung. I hope if I am ever tested to see if I truly stand on the right side of history I will not fall silent just because to do what is right is uncomfortable. I have got very comfortable doing the uncomfortable. If you think it is easy to maintain my dignity day in and say out among veterans that crack jokes and what I say or what I wear, it is not. It is just as hard for me as it would be for you. Please don’t discredit me because you think it’s easier for me to do what I do. I live in the same USA, understand the same culture. I know I will be mocked. My life and my sobriety are worth it. I will go to any lengths to maintain it! How far will you go? I have changed all that I am to my very core and it feels good. I actually have a shot this time. 😊 🏳️‍⚧️ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Happy thanksgiving everyone. I am so thankful for all that I have and all I have learned. This was Trish’s first thanksgiving. I am becoming a completely new/different person. I am experiencing true confidence for the first time in life. It was a busy day. Because of the holiday 3 days worth of homework is due for Friday. I hope I’m not disappointed by being the only person to follow the syllabus. People don’t understand these will not be topics we get to later, either we do them outside of class or we don’t cover them at all. I used to feel bad that I wanted more. I need to remember  im not a perfectionist or overachiever, I am just amongst a higher concentration of people that are okay with “good enough” in life. They seem content with the ordinary when I demand the extraordinary! I had to read about surrendering. It is impossible for me to surrender to drugs and alcohol. I am not enslaved to them. I just however surrender to reality. The Reality That I am a transgender woman. I could never accept that before. Life seemed so easy pretending to live behind the  facade of being a man. People listened to me, followed  me, and respected me. But I was miserable and constantly abused substances. As a woman people ignore me, dismis my opinions, and disrespect me, but I am happy. I chose to surrender to this paradox of my existence. I know life will be more difficult in some ways, but it will be a fulfilling life worth living. Once I surrendered to reality of who I was, my need for drugs and alcohol melted away. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s thanksgiving tomorrow.  Miss my family, I miss my kids. I feel so alone. I have tried reaching out but generally do not hear back from people. I am having such a hard time understanding my place in the world. At least i have the confidence to say I am o the right side of history. As as disable combat veteran I have been so lost since being forced out of he military with a medical retirement because of my injury in Afghanistan. I strive i a high temp arena, I need chaos and strife in y life. When life is too calm , I am bored and bored one results i negative behavior. Fighting for my rights and just basics equality here at the VA reminds me I am still alive. Sometimes life can be painful, but painful tells me I’m to dead. Sometimes life can loose all meaning when I have no emotion a boring life is easily confused for something that I should not be called life. Thank you world for being so cold and cruel at times, to have reminded me the taste of struggle. And in struggle as in war life has clarity. All meaning is intensified, and every moment of uncomfortability  has more meaning than the minuets of no feeling.  I’m so thankful to live in a country I can be who I am. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am not a drag queen, I am not a transvestite, I am not a cross dresser. Why do people constantly assume they know me because they lived in a city where they knew male prostitutes dressed as woman. Being transgender and selling your body in drag are very different things that generally gave nothing to do with each other. I feel I’m being called a whore or compared to one. I have never sold my body as a woman. Many times people are thinking of transvestites or  male prostitutes and drug. How would you like it if I compared knowing your mother, your sister, your daughter has relating them to prostitutes I knew in the city or the country or anywhere prostitutes are? It wouldn’t be a very nice thing to say would it? But I am constantly associated with drag queens, and transvestites. A drag queen is a man, usually a gay man the dresses up as a woman to perform. A transvestite or cross dresser is a man that wears women’s clothes in certain situations usually takes a still sexual desires. I am transgender woman. Being transgender has nothing to do with my sexuality.  It’s automaticly assumed I’m a gay man dressing up as a woman. I am a gay trans woman. I am attracted to woman sexually, but I know if a nan is attractive or not. Im Just not attracted to men in a sexual manner. So many assumptions are constantly made. I am just a person. A person with a very different culture. How my culture effects my behavior has nothing to do with being transgender. I keep waking up early walking around before I fix myself for the day, and the most common thing I hear is that I dress for attention. That is so sad that for the dress for the attention of others. I dress, and I’ve always dresses just for myself. I feel beautiful, I know I’m beautiful on the inside, I dress Beautiful on the outside. I dress for myself, I just to make myself happy. I have to get used to people that are jealous that I can be so happy, that I know myself, that I am comfortable in my own skin. I have to except people in a place like rehab just don’t like that. But that’s OK. They will eventually be people strong enough to make their own conclusions about me, not listen to the toxicity and poison of other people. I have met some great people, and some weak minded followers. Here is some basic vocabulary. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Basic Vocabulary </p>
<p class="card-body"> Binary – (noun) (1) the idea that there are only two genders — male/female or man/woman and that a person must be strictly gendered as either/or. (2) Of or pertaining to someone who identifies with one of the binary genders (man or woman). For example, there are both binary (man, woman) and non- binary (genderqueer, agender, gender-fluid) identities. See also nonbinary. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Cisgender or Cis – (adj; pronounced “siss-jendur”) frequently shortened to cis; a person whose gender identity and biological sex assigned at birth align (e.g., a cisman is man and male assigned at birth, a ciswoman is a woman and female assigned at birth). A simple way to think about it is if a person is not trans, they are cisgender. </p>
<p class="card-body">  “Cis” is a latin prefix that means “on the same side [as]” or “on this side [of]” </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Expression – (noun) the external display of one’s gender, through a combination of dress, demeanor, social behavior, and other factors, generally measured on scales of masculinity and femininity. Also referred to as “gender presentation.” </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Identity – (noun) the gender a person knows they are internally and how they label themselves. Common identity labels include male, female, genderqueer, non-binary, and more. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Considered to be one aspect of sex. When gender identity conflicts with other sex characteristics, such as chromosomes or genitalia, a person’s internal gender identity replaces their sex assigned at birth. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Nonbinary - (noun) (1) refers to any gender that is not exclusively male or female. A similar term is genderqueer. (2) Also is a way of thinking that sexuality, gender, and gender expression exist on a continuous spectrum as opposed to an either/or dichotomy. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Transgender or Trans – (adj) (1) Umbrella term covering a range of identities that transgress socially defined gender norms. (2) A person who lives as a member of a gender other than that assigned at birth. </p>
<p class="card-body">  A trans man is a man assigned female at birth. A trans woman is a woman assigned male at birth. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Trans does not indicate sexual attraction or sexual orientation. Transgender men attracted exclusively to men are gay; trans men attracted exclusively to women are straight. Transgender women attracted exclusively to women are lesbian; trans women attracted exclusively to men are straight. Trans (wo)men can also be bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or queer. Non-binary people, because 'gay' and 'straight' are ill-suited to describe people who do not identify as men or women, often use terms such as gynophilic/gynosexual if attracted to women, androphilic/androsexual if attracted to men, or bisexual/pansexual/asexual/queer. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Sex – (noun) a vague term used to refer to a number of characteristics traditionally associated with males and females, including, but not limited to: gender identity, sex chromosomes, genitalia (internal and external), endocrine system, and secondary sex characteristics. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Often seen as a binary but as there are many combinations of chromosomes, hormones, and primary/secondary sex characteristics, it’s more accurate to view this as a nonbinary spectrum (which is more inclusive of intersex people) </p>
<p class="card-body"> Additional common terms </p>
<p class="card-body"> Androgyny/ous – (adj; pronounced “an-jrah-jun-ee”) (1) a gender expression that has elements of both masculinity and femininity; (2) occasionally used in place of “intersex” to describe a person with both female and male anatomy </p>
<p class="card-body"> Bigender – (adj) a person who fluctuates between traditionally “woman” and “man” gender-based behavior and identities, identifying with both genders (and sometimes a third gender) </p>
<p class="card-body"> FAAB or MAAB or AFAB or AMAB – (noun) Female Assigned at Birth (FAAB) or Male Assigned at Birth (MAAB). This is generally used to denote what sex, male or female, was put on someone’s birth certificate. This is preferred to biological sex or born as male/female. </p>
<p class="card-body"> FtM or MtF – Female to Male (FtM) refers to someone who is transitioning or has transitioned from female to male, while Male to Female (MtF) refers to someone who is transitioning or has transitioned from male to female. Someone who identifies as FtM generally uses male pronouns and someone who identifies as MtF generally uses female pronouns. </p>
<p class="card-body">  These are terms that are generally 'in group' terms, which should not be used except in the special circumstance that someone asks to be so identified. The proper terms are "trans man" and "trans women." FtM still has some currency among trans men, but MtF is all but extinct. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender dysphoria – (noun) a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch conflict between their gender identity and their current gender expression, hormonal levels, and/or body. It is sometimes referred to as gender identity disorder (GID), gender incongruence, or transgenderism; all three of these terms are outdated and should not be used. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Note that not all trans people experience gender dysphoria, that gender dysphoria is not a prerequisite for transitioning, and that being transgender is not a disorder, disease, or illness! </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Fluid – (adj) gender fluid is a gender identity best described as a dynamic mix of male and female. A person who is gender fluid may feel like a mix of genders at times, more male at times, and/or more female at times. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) – (adj) someone whose gender presentation, whether by nature or by choice, does not align in a predicted fashion with the normative gender-based expectations present in society. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Normative / Gender Straight – (adj) someone whose gender presentation, whether by nature or by choice, aligns with the normative gender-based expectations present in society. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Genderqueer – (adj) a gender identity label often used by people who do not identify with the binary of man/woman; or as an umbrella term for many gender non-conforming or non-binary identities (e.g., agender, bigender, genderfluid). Genderqueer people may think of themselves as one or more of the following, and they may define these terms differently: </p>
<p class="card-body">  may combine aspects of male, female, and other identities (bigender, pangender); </p>
<p class="card-body">  may not have a gender or identify with a gender (genderless, agender); </p>
<p class="card-body">  may move between genders (genderfluid); </p>
<p class="card-body">  may identify as third gender or other-gendered (includes those who do not place a name to </p>
<p class="card-body"> their gender having an overlap of, or blurred lines between, gender identity and sexual and romantic orientation). </p>
<p class="card-body"> Gender Variant– (adj) someone who either by nature or by choice does not conform to the normative gender-based expectations present in society (e.g. transgender, intersex, genderqueer, etc.). </p>
<p class="card-body"> Intersex – (adj) someone whose combination of chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal sex organs, and genitals differs from the expected patterns of male or female. In the medical care of infants the initial is DSD (“Differing/Disorders of Sex Development”). Formerly known by the outdated and derogatory term "hermaphrodite" (or hermaphroditic), which should no longer be used. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Often seen as a problematic condition when babies or young children are identified as intersex, it was for a long term considered an “emergency” and something that doctors moved to “fix” right away in a newborn child. There has been increasing advocacy and awareness brought to this issue and many individuals advocate that intersex individuals should be allowed to remain intersex past infancy and to not treat the condition as an issue or medical emergency. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Pansexual – (adj) a person who experiences sexual, romantic, physical, and/or spiritual attraction for members of all gender identities/expressions. Sometimes shortened to "pan." </p>
<p class="card-body"> Passing – (verb) (1) a term for trans people being accepted as, or able to “pass for,” a member of their self-identified gender/sex identity (regardless of birth sex) without being identified as trans. (2) An LGB/queer individual who is believed to be or perceived as straight. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Passing is a controversial term because it often is focusing on the person who is observing or interacting with the individual who is “passing” and puts the power/authority in observer rather than giving agency to the individual. </p>
<p class="card-body">  While some people are looking to “pass” or perhaps more accurately be accepted for the identity that they feel most aligns with who they are “passing” is not always a positive experience. </p>
<p class="card-body">  Some individuals experience a sense of erasure or a feeling of being invisible to their own community when they are perceived to be part of the dominant group. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Transition(ing) – (noun &amp; verb) this term is primarily used to refer to the process a trans person undergoes when changing their outward appearance either to be more congruent with the gender/sex they feel themselves to be and/or to be in harmony with their preferred gender expression. </p>
<p class="card-body"> Terms to avoid that create microaggresions </p>
<p class="card-body">  Born a girl, born a boy, biologically male, biologically female </p>
<p class="card-body">  Biological sex is considered deeply problematic and should *never* be used. It has become a weaponized term used politically against the trans community, and is inherently incoherent when discussing transgender people. In general, when an individual uses this, they *mean* to say, "sex/gender assigned at birth." </p>
<p class="card-body">  Trans with an asterisk (*) was once used to indicate that the term was an inclusive umbrella for many genders, but the asterisk has since been discarded as at best unnecessary and at worst stigmatizing and should no longer be used. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I am surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. I relied to much on my good friend from Maine , now with out him I N so alone. I don’t fit in with the males, and I don’t get a chance to see if I fit in with the females. I am still discovering what it means to get me. I am developing my full female identity, and it is not easy. I really wish me fellow female veterans would help me understand things better. I think they see me more as a man In woman’s clothes Than a woman wearing a mans body. Being so isolated from females and surrounded by a hyper toxic masculine environment, my soul dwindles and my mind recoils. But at least my PTSD is at bay. When your country is ar war 1/3 if your life, and you are a part of the military fighting in those wars, you become accustomed to the struggle. Not necessarily the struggle of daily combat or constant trauma. When I was in a military ar war, I had a purpose. A very well defined purpose. Once I was injured in Afghanistan and retired from the Army, my purpose was over. I also no longer had the gender neutrality of the uniform to hide behind. I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the boredom. I grew up in chaos, I love it, I need it, I can’t live without it. Hi thrived in high tempo Arenas. The insanity of a wartime environment with some thing I could actually understand. I loved not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Every day my life had more meaning than any other day of my life it seems. When you go out on a mission not knowing if that’s your very last, you tend to appreciate everything that much more. Well that all ended I was lost. Since coming out as a transgender woman I have discovered a new war, new battles to fight. I once again struggle. My life is no longer boring. My life once again has meaning. Obviously this can’t be very healthy. But it is what it is. I am on constant guard, hypervigilance, I am so high strong being living in the situation I’m living. In a sick way the fear, and Uncomfortability keep me going. I have new goals to reach. I strive for something more than I ever thought possible. I feel unstoppable. Why life was so miserable, so misunderstood, so confusing as a man, but as a transgender woman everything makes sense again. I can’t really say it again, because it makes sense for the first time in my whole life. I feel I truly no happiness. Everything in life I felt I was looking for I have found. I have truly found meaning in my life, with meaning in life I no longer wanna die. Since I no longer want to die, I no longer need drugs and alcohol to get me just byOne more day. I am truly grateful.  </p>

<p class="card-body"> Gender dysphoria? I don’t think people take me seriously sometimes at the VA when I talk about my gender dysphoria. That vets can talk about their combat PTSD and accommodations are made, people bend over backwards not to offend them, trigger them, or upset them. But when it comes to how uncomfortable I feel between biologically being a male and how I identify as a female. Nobody wants to hear about it. It hurts, it upsets me when the system reinforces that they view me as a male and not a female. Am I a male wearing female clothes? Or am I a female wearing a males body? Those are two very different questions. I reside on federal property I am currently living at the VA in Bath New York. I am in the Domicilary for rehab. While on VA property I may use the restroom/bathroom according to how I identify not my biological gender. So I use the women’s bathroom. But I am housed with the man. I cannot have other female Veterans come to my room. But other females can come down the hall if they’re visiting the female social worker. So every time I am told they cannot make a special exception for me because they know they’d have to make an exception for all the guys, it makes me feel terrible. They are telling me they consider me part of all the guys. Why am I forced to be reminded of my biological gender? Why am I segregated based on my biological gender versus The general identify has? This depresses me, this gives me anxiety, this just straight up makes me feel bad. I don’t understand why I’m not allowed to have female friends come to where I am living, or why I can’t go to where they’re living? The VA is constantly reminding me that they view me as a male and that’s it they do not believe I am female in anyway when I am in a very basic level surrounded by men. What other conclusion can I come to in my head? Every day I have to walk down the hall and be reminded no matter how beautiful I look how old or how much I tell myself I know who I am, the message that I’m not who I say I am is constantly forced upon me. And it hurts.￼￼￼￼￼￼ But despite the VA triggering my gender dysphoria, attacking my identity, and lowering my self esteem and confidence by refusing to acknowledge I am not male, I will not give up. I will keep my head high. I know who I am, and I am learning not to give institutions line the VA the power over me to effect my confidence or self esteem. I hate the hypocrisy of a federal institution not following federal guidelines. I was told I am housed with the men for safety reasons. What does that mean. I can use the women’s bathroom. Woman can be in my hall to see the social worker but they can’t see me? Both the social worker and I are female by the definition the federal government has advised. We are to get treated the same. The Social worker is an employee, I am a patient , but we identify as the same gender. Please treat me the same . All as ask for is some respect, equality, and for federal guidelines to be followed. 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️ 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️ 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I wonder how many more mass shootings there will be before this country finally gets a handle on our gun problem. Having a constitutional right to own a weapon is not the same as a absolute right to do what ever you feel you should be able to do. I wonder how many more people will die as a direct result of this acquittal? If this is not white privileged, what is? Had this een a black man that had killed whites or women I suspect the verdict ay have gone different. Sending the message that its okay to bring a loaded weapon of mass suffering to a highly emotional and pliticly charged event sends a very dangerous message. I fear this will be directly responsible for additional deaths, </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Not an easy day. I keep feeling like I am getting the message that I am less than human. When I arrived at the Bath VA I. August of this year I identified at non-binary transgender. For so we reason I think staff thought that meant  was identifying as male. I dressed as a female just did not use she/hers. I used they their. I did not feel I was worthy for f being called female. I had a very negative image as a male. Extensive gender dysphoria. I was housed with males when I arrived and has a room mate and shared a bathroom with two more males. 30 days later I was moved to a private room, but still with the males. I get made fun of by the makes for using the men’s bathroom. I got told not to use the female bathroom. I can’t socialize with fellow female veterans. I feel the VA will not allow me to be happy as a female. They constantly remind me I’m male biologicaly by separating me from the females. It hurts every day to be told I’m not truly accepted. No matter how pretty I might feel I am, how much I know I’m a woman on the inside, the Bath VA keeps telling me I’m a male, by how they treat me.I’m forced to be housed with the makes, I can’t enter a woman’s bathroom when there is no gender neutral bathroom available. I can not socialize with fellow female veterans in the female lounge. I am segregated by my biology rather than my identity. I thought this was an illegal practice at federal buildings like the veterans administration. I have asked multiple times for clarification and I’m still waiting six weeks later 😢 😭 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> It’s so confusing being trans in a VA (veterans hospital) facility. I identify as a trans woman that is only sexually attracted to women. I get confused, am I a gay transgender female or a heterosexual mtf transgender? When I was younger you where either “normal” or a “fag”. Yes it was that direct. No middle ground. Being gay was something I was taught was a bad thing from very young age. I had a very liberal and progressive family that still frowned on homosexuality. So what woukd they think of their son that wanted to get their daughter. I was further confused if I should like men because I felt I was a woman. I was double wrong. To this day the fact I identify as a transgender woman attracted to woman causes issues. I sometimes wonder if life would be easier if I was gay. Doubtful. I have been taught to hate myself my whole  life. I am so lucky I love my self. With so many mixed messages I’m shocked I’m doing as well as I think I’m doing. I’m still figuring out my place under the LFBTQ umbrella. So many new words tgat hyst did not exist in ny world in the 1990’s. I’m also a veteran and retired service member. The average veteran does not seem to release how many fellow vets are LGBTQ. In a Place like rehab there are a disproportionate increase in the amount of LGBTQ veterans because of the difficulty of living a life with a foot in both the military and LGBTQ world. I’m still trying to find my place in the world. People take issue that I will not be satisfied taking “enough” , I will always push for more. I will not sit quite and accept the crumbs of cake the establishment will give me to placate NT demands. And when the very low bar of “enough” is not met, I definitely won’t be silent or silenced. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Being a transgender female veteran at the Bath VA DOM can be challenging. No matter how many times I’m told the VA respects my identity, policy after policy rend to show that They did not think every policy thorough. No mater how many times fellow veterans tell me they don’t judge me on how I look, I realize people lie. It’s difficult being a transgender female veteran. Other veterans tell me they treat me like any other veteran, some tell me they treat me just like any other female, so I’m just say they treat me like any other veteran. 90% of the time that’s total bullshit. I’m friends with a fellow female veteran and when people come up to her they give her their number tell her to call them any time say text me if you have any issues I’m here for you anytime you need me. Very few people ever come up to me and say that. Nobody came up to me and never said that. When you treat me completely different from how you treat a fellow female veteran you are basically telling me you do not except me for who I am. You are making me feel like a freak, you’re making me feel like you don’t respect me. You make me feel like I don’t belong. When I see 40 , 50, 60-year-old men going and going over someone half their age and trying to pass off that they’re just doing it in a friendly matter my question is whyis it just for one person how come you don’t treat everyone like this? You certainly do not treat fellow male veterans like this all the time. You certainly did not treat me like this. So it just makes me wonder yes my fellow veterans realize just how they come across. I wish people would just be honest with me. Tell me they at least respect me as a fellow veteran I am, the disabled combat veteran that I am. And if I make them feel uncomfortable, or I’m just not the type of person they want to associate with, let me know I can understand that. I may not like that that’s how they feel but at least they’re honest with me. It’s better than pretending you care, only to find out what it really looks like when you care or take interest in a fellow veteran. That hurts, it hurts to find out that I was lied to, it hurts to find out I’m considered less than another. But as in life, life is full of double standards, catch 22s, and double edged sword. I accept all this. Hopefully overtime this will change. I wish I was charged more for my personality, for my actions, for my words, rather than white people think they say or want to say that isn’t the true me. I hope someday people take a look at how they judge other people and judge the way they want to be judged. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m sad my friend is leaving today and happy I have made a new friend. I am 100 days into recovery from drugs and alcohol. For the first time in my life I know what it feels like to be happy. People in my life are upset that I’m happy, they don’t understand my definition of happy is not wanting to die anymore. Waking up being thankful I’m alive and looking forward to the next day. When every day I was forced to level lie, and society shoved down my throat that I was a deviant, sick in the head, mentally ill, I felt like I was going to lose my mind. Life was so hard, So difficult, so painful. All I wanted to do was get drunk or get a high to numb the pain, the pain of being who I was. It wasn’t until I transitioned to be the beautiful transgender woman that I am that I learned what it was like to be happy. This did not come overnight. First I had to be very honest with myself, and as uncomfortable as it felt at first, it felt more comfortable being honest me then then being the pretend me. I was living a lie my whole life and now 100 days later I’ve laid all the fun Dacian of an honest life without alcohol and drugs being my true self that momentum has caught up with me and I know what it’s like to be happy. My childhood, my adolescence, my young adulthood, my adulthood now has been so awkward, so difficult, so insanely crazy. My life has been so confusing I never understood what was wrong with me. It turns out there was nothing wrong with me it was something very wrong with society. Society wanted to judge and label me and tell me who I was and who I wasn’t what I could be and what I couldn’t be and that killed a part of me on the inside. Once society opened up a little bit, and all it took was a crack. My light was able to shine, and turn me into the person I’ve always wanted to be. I don’t know Who that person exactly is yet. But I’m finding out a little more each day and becoming a little bit happier each day. I still have to deal with ignorant people telling me what it means to be a transgender woman. They tell me how I’m supposed to act how I’m allowed to look, who I’m allowed to like, who am I allowed to be attracted to, next thing they’re going to tell me what I like to eat and what I don’t like to eat. People are just so judge mental. I am so sick of trying to fit into some sort of category to make someone else feel better. There’s nothing worse than someone coming up and telling me they’ve learned about my people which I have no idea what exactly my people means. And then they point out things I do differently from what they think they learned and asked me why I am not normal. And by normal they mean what their idea of transgender is. Or oh I didn’t know you could really be transgender and do that or do this, or are you sure that’s really what you like, are you sure you’re being honest with yourself? You’ve got a love people. Every day they find something new to be insulting about something you’d be judge mental about something new to be insecure about themselves about. Thank you world for all the beautiful kind gentle souls that are supported me give me a kind word of encouragement, a complement here, reassurance there. For those people all I have to say is thank you. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I had a great day. I am very happy today I’ve been very happy lately. Today I keep wondering about Covid and masks. When someone takes off their mask for the first time. Do you notice them looking better or worse? I always imagine the most beautiful or most handsome person under the mask, and when they takeoff the mask I have always been disappointed, they never live up to that image I had in my head. I wonder if it depends on if you’re a positive person or a negative person what type of imagery you have of people under the mask and I wonder how much could be a metaphor for other things in life. There hasn’t been a massive pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1917. This is the first time where society globally has been affected by social distancing, masks, forced vaccines,. There will be thesis is written for years to come on all the different facts Covid is hard on society. Telling you the mask distortion is A hypothesis of mine. I propose that since I have a positive outlook I want to imagine underneath that mask is a beautiful face and I draw and images to connect those dots. Until I see was under the mat I am going to assume it’s the most wonderful face I can imagine and that’s what I do I literally imagine a beautiful or handsome face. Once the mask is removed it inevitably leads to disappointment. This can be sad for many things in life where I always assume the best in things, people, systems. And when the veil is removed like when Toto pulls back the veil on the great Wizard of Oz I am always disappointed and sometimes a bit freaked out to see just how wrong I was same way when some people remove the mask and I say my God COVID was the best thing that ever happened to this person I’m sometimes shocked at how much credit I was giving people places and things and systems as well giving things the benefit of the doubt I was giving them far too much credit. </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m starting to learn so much about myself. I am learning that I don’t know people and I don’t know people I thought I was below average I gave people in the room the same attributes as myself. Turns out I’m much smarter much more confident much better looking much more apt then the majority of the people in the room sometimes I am the best and almost everything in a room. I’m not saying I always them but sometimes I am. And that’s very different from a time when I thought I never was. Here in rehab it’s been very difficult for me being in a world of such toxicity. Being constantly surrounded by such broken people. So much lies so many people that lie constantly. So many people are just so jealous. It’s obvious when people are jealous of who you are and what you have that they will go to any lengths to bring you down. I get that. People love talking behind your back. I can’t let that bother me anymore. I am discovering who I am. And I am so excited about the future holds for me. I have to look at the past 40 years I was one of the most expensive universities ever. What I have learned about the worlds is so valuable. And I can put it into practice in ways I can’t possibly imagine yet. I will be coming unstoppable force. Thank you to all those that believe in me. I love all of you!!!￼￼￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> People love to place you in a box. They need to categorize you. I know I fall under the LGBTQ umbrella but where? I know what it means to be a lesbian, gay, bisexual, but what does it mean to be T? Is T transsexual, transgender, transvestite (kind of a trick question). If you don’t know the answer most people don’t know the answer and even if they did know answer they can’t define what the differences between those three tees. I am a transgender female. I am not a homosexual I am not bisexual, I am Hetrosexual. ￼￼I would not mind if I was born gay I would not mind if I was bi. All those things are fine with me, the issue is that’s just not who I am. I am a transgender female that is attracted to other females. And I’m constantly told that I am lying to myself that that can’t possibly be true. It’s all because I don’t fit neatly in the other peoples boxes. I am told I must surely be attracted to men I must be suppressing my sexual urges. Who are people to tell me who I am. Who are people to tell me what I should be? Sometimes I wish I was gay because it would make life easier, or had I just been born a woman. But I can’t change those things. I am happy with who I am and don’t need people approval or understanding to me me. I love me!!!￼￼￼ </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I feel insulted sometimes that it seems if society gives me free things on Veterans Day and I take them, I’m signing a contract that allows them to forget about me the rest of the year. There aren’t many farmers and there are many people that have served in the military just like people don’t truly know where their food comes from people don’t truly know where the rights and freedoms come from just like buying your meat in the grocery store it’s a bloody messy job war is also very similar. And people do not want to know the Nitti gritty details and how their food gets the grocery store or how 'We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough men (Women) stand ready to do violence on our behalf'. I don’t want a free coffee or a special meal off your special veterans menu at Olive Garden. I want access to mental health, I want therapy not a pill. There is a problem when so many of my fellow veterans chose to kill themself rather than live another day. Companies are using the blood, tears, and sweat of veterans to advertise what a great company they are by offering “cake” to us once a year, rather than lobby Congress on our behalf for real change. It’s because all these free meals benefits them far more then it’s helping veterans and our issues. So, no I’m not going to say thank you to them. It disgusts me that people don’t see the practice for what it truly is. A PR campaign that pays out far more than it costs.  Everyone wants to help a veteran , a company that gives a free meal or coffe must be a good company for helping . But really they are just exploiting the name Veterans and playing of post 9/11 emotions. 😡 </p>

				<p class="card-body"> I’m sad I only have one more week left with my good friend Waman Mills, before he moves on to bigger and better thing’s . He has taught me so much. I need to make the best out of the time left and pray our paths cross again in life. Why is it so hard for me to make real friends in life ? Why don’t I appreciate things when I have them, I feel things will never change, then when they do my world crashes .

				<p class="card-body"> Happy Sunday. I spent the last 42 years being a White Anglo Saxon Protestant Male in the United States that is also a a disabled combat veteran. I don’t think it gets much more privileged than that. I know how I was treated. I know how I’m treated now. My personality has not changed, I’m the same out spoken intelligent person I was before. Some people just don’t like admitting im right when I’m a transgender female dressed like a transgender female. They feel more comfortable hearing it from me when I’m a transgender female dressed like a male. (at VA Finger Lakes Healthcare System) https://www.instagram.com/p/CV_F4rbpFgY/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>

				<p class="card-body"> Happy Saturday! I have 90 days clean today. What do you see when you look at me? Do you see the father that Luy lived his daughter? The disabled combat veteran? A beautiful human? Or something else that upsets you? Here in rehab at a VA facility I am running into all forms of people at their very best and their very worst. That includes both staff and patients. The amount of daily hypocrisy that goes on here is mind blowing. The amount of bullying and discrimination makes me sick. But the kindness and compassion from the most unlikely gives me hope. (at VA Finger Lakes Healthcare System) https://www.instagram.com/p/CV8RPoLroUs/?utm_medium=tumblr </p>
